My name is **Eliot Cochrane**. I'm a life-long skier and a full-time tinkerer. Beginning to ski at the age of four, my passion for the sport has never diminished. I volunteer my time at the local ski hill to teach elementary aged children to ski and also coach the alpine ski racers at night on weekdays. Much of my time is now spent within the sport trying to give back and inspire the next generation to continue.

During my time and making friends within the ski community, golf became a common avenue to meet people and continue to expand upon the relationships that I built over the prior ski seasons. Golf too has become a bridge in my personal life and professional life that has introduced me to people and opportunities I never thought I would experience. Much of my time is spent in the outdoors and golf is a good way to keep me motivated to stay out there.

First coming to Japan, skiing was not even remotely on my radar. I was so excited to experience a new country that I had forgotten about skiing. Fate would have it, my very first night out on the town would be fated with the local ski club. With their broken English and my nearly non-existent Japanese, I was immediately invited to join. Like many ski clubs around the world, the average age of their members has been increasing every year. The age gap to the next youngest member was nearly double my age!

After getting a pair of women's SL skis from Ogasaka and having my old pair of Salomon boots shipped to Japan, I was ready to ski when the snow came. My first season was a loud wake-up call as I had been a relatively good skier in my hometown area in America. But little did I know that my little ski hill was a training hill for some of the regional athletes. With only one trail, a slow single pair lift, and blue and red ski gates lining the sides of the slope ready to be set, I made by first venture back into racing.

It was a blissful time as I progressed and could visibly see the times drop and my technique improving in pictures and video. Soon I was invited to the prefectural race tournament as support. Unfortunately I didn't have a national body membership so I couldn't race but I was able to support my new teammates. Still awe-struck with visiting a new Japanese ski resort, I schlepped bags full of outerwear and ski tuning boxes to the bottom. Snowplowing by each gate with their ever present gatekeepers doing double takes to see a foreigner on the race hill. In the following years, I have participated in every prefectural race.

From then on, I was back in the world of alpine skiing. Little did I know that the world of alpine skiing and alpine golf almost go hand in hand. THe following season I was invited to my first golf experience in Japan.

The same group that had introduced me back to skiing once again introduced me back into the world of golfing. Previously, I had played golf one or two summers. In addition, a family friend lived adjacent to a golf course and after the last group, my brother and I would take 3 clubs each and a random lost ball and do a 3 hole loop until there was no more light in the day. From there we would go back and have dinner and go home.

My first adventure on the golf course in Japan was with some old clubs that a guy found in a house he was cleaning out for work. The clubs were an old set from yearly 15 years prior. Horrible grips, pool noodle like shafts, and big chunky heads. But... they were free.

After a few rounds with those clubs, I continued within the first year to build my own bag little by little which is finally something that I'll probably never change going into the future. Because just like the 3 clubs I brought onto the the course at night, more than what is in the bag, I'm more interested interested in going to new places and trying to find what makes a golf course shine compared to others. I don't spring for the premium resort-like experiences, I don't buy the fancy clothes, and I don't care how high up your socks go.

Both my childhood ski and golfing experience helped mold my preferences on where I want to ski and golf. Preferring the locally owned hills and courses running on a shoe-string budget, I always try to venture off the beaten path. It has lead me to meet incredible people, make connections throughout the Tohoku region of Japan, and continue a life-long love of learning.
