## <center>Jeunesse Kurikoma</center>
### <center>Short But Endless Laps</center>

***

A bit far from the crowd and not easy to get to, but the small size and non-existent lift lines make Jeunesse Kurikoma a favorite to all within the area. It's a tiny little ski area that does have an onsen attached to make a quiet little getaway in the southern mountains of Akita. The simplicity of Jeunesse Kurikoma is what keeps the regulars coming back year after year.

Located in the southern part of the Akita Prefecture in Northern Japan, Jeunesse Kurikoma is nestled in the area known as Hagashinaruse which is southeast of Yokote. It's quite a drive to get all the way back into the mountains but it is quite a beautiful drive along the river. Along the way are plenty of traditional houses, great views, and even a shrine with a water fountain that never stops delivering clean water. Every older skier I talked to on the lift made sure to bring a water tank just to stop at that shrine.

Don't let the laid back attitude of a ski area fool you. This ski area is also prone to some weather anomalies that surrounding areas might not be prone to. That includes the snow dumps, but also the windy days that sweep all that snow into the snowfields for a nearly fresh reset of the area.

### Hidden Peace

It's not so easy to get to Jeunesse Kurikoma, which lends to the small lift lines and plenty of powder to find when it does dump. On the backside of Jeunesse Kurikoma lies Mt. Kurikoma which does have a road which is beautiful to drive in summer. But during the winter this is closed and nearly cuts off all access from the center of Miyagi to the center of Iwate. But the skiers that choose Jeunesse Kurikoma are a different breed of skier.

The people who choose Jeunesse Kurikoma definitely prefer the smaller ski areas with simple amenities. Rentals are available but don't expect the latest gear. Ski school is available but don't expect any English speakers. There is a restaurant for food, but don't expect something to die for (although the pizza is pretty good albeit expensive).

Jeunesse Kurikoma is a great place to avoid rushes. There are no traffic jams on the way and there is always a spot to get your gear on in the lodge. Thankfully, they have recently expanded their bag storage area so your bag always has a place too!

### Endless Runs

Jeunesse Kurikoma is a ski area that defines peace and ability to ski at your pace. It doesn't boast the snow that Geto Kogen in Iwate does, so while many people skip Jeunesse Kurikoma for Geto Kogen powder, the powder they do get is stress free and will be there all day for you. That's not to say that they don't get powder.

I have been there multiple times specifically for powder up to my hips. While everyone went to the bigger places with fancier lifts, Jeunesse Kurikoma was powder all day because only 5%ã€œ10% of the skiers were actually in the powder.

Here, there are so few people that at any given time, there is almost no wait at the lift lines. The runs may be short compared to other mountains, but there is no wait time. Especially at the quad, the runs may be shorter but the lift long is equally short so it feels like the perfect distance to get tired but not exhausted after each run.

### Mountain Layout

Shuffling skiers and snowboarders up the mountain are three lifts, the first pair-lift is on the skier's far left. This is the beginner slope but can be painful for beginners as the long slope to the lift is extremely flat and difficult to keep speed to the lift for beginners.

Directly in front of the lodge is the super-quad lift to bring skiers up mid mountain. This is a quick lift which provides the most access and the smoothest ride. Giving access to the front facing slopes and also the powder field between the first pair lift and the quad, this is the most popular lift on any given day.

The final lift is the third pair lift from midway to the top. On powder day this is one of the more popular lifts. Anything surrounding the lift is ungroomed. With some steeps, some entry level powder, and a return course to the rest of the mountain, Jeunesse Kurikoma is really go at your own pace. Skiing under the lift is also no problem. The ski patrol may rescind this if snow conditions make it hazardous below the lift but in almost all situations it is fine to ski under the lift.

### Accommodations

Jeunesse Kurikoma is pretty far away from anything resembling a town or city. To remedy this, an onsen was built on site and is also surrounded by smaller places. These places are a little bit old but the odd one here or there are still quite enjoyable to stay at.

But the Yamayuri Onsen at Hotel Blanc is the main place to stay. With an onsen overlooking the main slope, it is easy to see why it stands above all the others. It was also recently remodelled a few years back and is in great condition. Those that do stay have only had praise for Hotel Blanc.
