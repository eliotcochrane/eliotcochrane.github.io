As the season draws closer, we'll look into the best things you can do to make your winter more enjoyable and safer too. These will range from things you can do for your fitness, mental preparation, and gear oriented changes that you can make before the season starts. Be sure to give each a good read and make a decision of what is best for you to make your winter in Japan fun and safe.

Ski season is approaching and many ski enthusiasts are gearing up for the exciting trips they have planned to Japanese ski resorts. Putting in the time to make sure that gear has been fully checked out is important. But just as important as the gear on the hill is that which you leave at the base.

The snowy landscapes provide a beautiful landscape with breathtaking views but they also bring unique challenges to road travel. Winterizing your vehicle is a crucial step to make sure that your adventures on the mountains are a safe and enjoyable journey from start to finish. In this guide, we'll break down a preseason checklist to prepare your vehicle for the Japanese winter.

### Winter Tires

**Why It's Important:** Tires are the main contact between you and the road. Even the best off-road car will be futile without a good tire to keep the vehicle in control. Winter tires are especially important to provide improved traction and control on icy or snow-covered surfaces.

**What You Can Do:** Ensure that your tires are equipped with winter tires designed for snowy and icy conditions. Within the four tires, make sure they their all have equal and ample tread for the snow to disperse. 

**All-season tires are not as safe as you would think.**

Let's look at some stopping data from the [Ontario Ministry of Transportation](http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/safety/pdfs/winter-safe-driving.pdf). They took 3 types of vehicles and and tested in temperatures of -20Â°C with 3cm to 5cm of compacted ice and snow on asphalt. All vehicles were required to stop ina  straight line from a speed of 50km/h.

* All-Season (AS)
* Winter (W)

| Car Type | AS Tire Stopping Distance | W Tire Stopping Distance | % Improvement AS > W |
| :----: |  :----: |  :----: |  :----: | 
| Subcompact | 50.7m | 39.1m | ~25% |
| Minivans | 51.1m | 38.3m | ~28% |
| 4WD Vehicle | 42.8m | 38.3m | 11% |

All car types across the board received a significant improvement in stopping distance when using winter tires. The average improvement when changing to snow tires can be just over **20%**.

Would you risk your safety with those odds?

### Fluids and Battery

**Why It's Important:** Proper fluids like engine coolant, anti-freeze, windshield washer fluid, and engine oil can all help during the cold winters. Matching these with a strong battery will ensure that your car will start in the coldest of colds.

**What You Can Do:** Check and replenish all liquids specifically designed for colder climates. Verify that other essential fluids like washer fluid, engine oil, and brake fluid are at their recommended levels. For batteries, getting a battery check when changing or checking fluids is a great time to get everything done in one appointment.

### Wipers and Windshield

***Why It's Important:** Clear visibility is essential for driving. Properly functioning wipers and defrosters can keep your windshield remaining clear is snowy and extremely cold conditions. Many coatings can also help with maintaining visibility. Cleaning the inside of the windshield is just as important as the outside. When cleaning the inside, be sure to use an anti-fogging agent to assist in keeping the winter looking good throughout all conditions.

**What You Can Do:** Similar to all-season tires, winter wipers are a must in extremely snowy and cold areas to maintain proper functioning. Purchase winter wipers and keep make sure to do a visual check everything you can. At night or during the day, it is advised to also lift your wipers away from the windshield. This will prevent them from freezing directly to the windshield and also make it easier to scrape the windshield.

### Snow Management (Shovel, Brush, Scraper, Traction Aid)

**Why It's Important:** Snow is going to be a part of your life if you want to be a skier. A snow brush can help you clear the snow from your windows, lights, and the roof of your vehicle. A scraper can do the same to remove ice. A shovel can be used to dig your car out in case of emergencies, of course, but many times just the snow around your vehicle needs to be cleared to move unimpeded. Lastly, should you get stuck and need more traction, a traction aid (there are many to choose from) are great to have.

**What You Can Do:** Keep a brush in your car designated for your windshield and car roof is best. Using it too much on other parts of the car might introduce dirt to the brush which can scratch your windshield and paintwork in the future. An ice scraper and shovel are also easy to purchase and put in your car. Let's continue with traction aids. There are many to choose from.

| Traction Aid | Pros (+) | Cons (-) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Tire Chains | Very strong grip and useable for long distances | Time consuming to attach and speed is restricted |
| Traction Mat | Immediate traction, reuseable, light | Not ideal on ice, difficult in deep snow, limited traction coverage |
| Sand | Affordable, non-corrosive, static weight provides extra grip | Heavier in large quantities, fuel economy may reduce |
| Cat Litter | Affordable, non-corrosive | Limited traction compared to others, effectiveness drastically drops when wet |

### Emergency Kit

**Why It's Important:** Unpredictable weather and road conditions will inevitably lead to unforeseen consequences. Emergency kits can keep you safe until help arrives. For such little weight and space, it could possibly save your life in an emergency.

**What You Can Do:** Prepare an emergency kit that includes a first-aid kit, blankets, warm clothing, winter-ready gloves, and a flashlight at the bare minimum. Other items can include non-perishable food, water, and a portable phone charger. Other car items can include tow ropes and a set of jumper cables. Keeping these in an accessible location within your car are necessary in case of emergency.

##### CAUTION
**Tow Ropes:** These are very commonly used when pulling cars out of the snow or on low traction roads but there is a danger. The line from the attachment points *must* remain clear because when the line is taut there is no mercy from the rope. Anything in the way will be moved or pinned.

**Jumper Cables:** Incorrect usage can pose several dangers including electrical shocks, vehicle damage, and even the risk of fire or explosion if not connected correctly. It's crucial to follow safety guidelines when jump-starting a vehicle. Check if your cables come with a guide to the proper usage. If not, check your owners manual. Hybrids also have a different procedure depending on the car's battery layout. When in doubt, refer to the car owner's manual.

### Summary

A well-prepared vehicle is the key to a successful and safe road trip to ski resorts and back-country access points. By following some preseason tips to get ready for the weather, your ski season can steer clear of disaster and be the best it can be. So get your car prepared and be ready for when the snow starts to fly!

Stay safe and have a safe journey!
