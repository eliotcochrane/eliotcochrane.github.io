The skis that I am on the most are the most versatile for free skiing and helping at events but are also my most aggressive skis. Unfortunately, these came with the race stock for distributing to the regional and World Cup Japanese racers within the Tohoku region. The skis are super light and easier to maneuver but don't be fooled by that. These skis are a wild animal ready to pounce at the moment you relax in the turn.

### Rossignol Black Ops Sender Ti (187cm)

This is the go-to crud ski that opened my eyes to a possible one quiver. It never left me exhausted, and it never left me wanting much more. It was the perfect balance.
* Soft enough for skiing all day
* Stiff enough to hold on ice
* Wide enough for powder
* Easy to manage side cut
* Light enough to carry and hike

## BOOTS
### HEAD Raptor WCR 4 (2022)

This boot changed my outlook on fit in a performance boot. After many years of custom fitting, this is the first where it all came together in one package. In 2022, the toe box had been expanded, and during the 2021 season, I was lucky enough to test drive the boot a year early thanks to one of HEAD Japan's longest-serving regional representatives. Over three seasons, a few of the retention springs broke so some of the buckles are loose, the stretch on the power straps are a little too much and had to be replaced with a Booster Strap, and the outer heel pieces of the inner liners are falling apart. But no matter how many times I look at other boots, I always come back to them with joy. They're my comfortable cobbled mess.
