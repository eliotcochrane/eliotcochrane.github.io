## <center>Deep Dive: Power Straps</center>
### <center>Response, Flex, and Support</center>

***

Often times power straps are the underdog when it comes to attention in ski boots. All of the attention is put towards things like the volume, closure system, or range-of-motion. Yet the power strap is one of the most critical elements to a ski boot with regards to fit, performance, and comfort. It's not just a mere fastener to be done along the way, it's one of the main conductors connecting you to your skis.

The power strap is an unassuming part of the ski boot but can contribute to transmitting power greater than many may expect. This band of material embodies function and form by still meeting aesthetics while still performing a vital function of transferring power from you to your skis through your ski boots. When we buckle our ski boots and tighten our power strap, we establish a connection with our gear, and in turn, the mountains.

### Importance

Precision and control are the ingredients necessary for your best sking and the strap plays a role in this symphony of a sport. The strap keeps your foot in the optimal position, allowing for the proper movements of your foot within the boot. Whether it's carving down iced up slopes or navigating endless powder fields, the power strap ensures that your movements are transmitted to the ski with finesse. 

Over the past 10 or so years, power straps have been getting the attention they deserve. After the introduction of the cam-style buckle to help leverage the tightening mechanism for a closer fit, power straps have been getting new features like improved materials, making them wider, or making different models geared towards the consumer and their needs.

### Customization and Comfort

The power strap sets itself apart by being able to adapt to your unique needs. In today's market, there are many different types of power straps, each with their own unique shape, features, and construction. Each of these mdoels are geared towards a particular skier and the needs that they need filled. This allows for fine tuning to be done to the boot by bootfitters around the world, whether you prefer a snug race-like boot setup or a relaxed fit for leisurely blue-bird days, power straps allow you to fine-tune the fit.

The fit is important to any piece of gear but a power strap can help reduce overall movement in the feet to feel comfortable all the way to the last run. By eliminating pressure points and unnecessary movement, the power strap keep your foot where it needs to be throughout the turn to help provide the best feedback from the skis and the boots. 

### Types

**Static**
This is the traditional view of what people think of when they hear 'power strap'. Static straps are as their name suggests, they do not stretch or deform under force or tension. Many years ago, these types of straps were reknown for giving sore shins, nicknamed "shin bang", at the end of a long day but have stuck around for a multitude of reasons. The biggest being that a static strap is the best way to unlock performance because of the direct transfer of energy into the cuff.

But the technology has also shifted within static straps as well. Many power straps have been velcro and maintain to be velcro at lower end models. Now many static straps are incorporating cam-buckles to give relief when not going downhill but easily cinched by pulling on the tail strap to be ready. Many have also increased in width to help distribute the energy over a wider space and reduce "shin bang" in certain areas.

**Elastic**
But just as ski sidecuts have changed over the years, so to has the technology for power straps. The power straps are now uitilizing more materials and can be balanced for your preference. Elastic power straps serve to be more dynamic where the further the boot and power belt are stressed, the more rigid it will become. This characteristic is great for tailoring to a skiers level and also their use case.

In scenarios with repeated impacts, such as moguls or when landing jumps, elastic power straps can help to alleviate harsh impacts by allowing the boot to flex more throughout the impact. These are often praised for reducing or eliminating "shin bang" by removing space between the tongue/cuff of the boot and the leg itself and allowing for appropriate pressure during the closure of the buckles.

### Options

Ski boots will often come with a stock power strap that is velcro based. These are static power straps but those looking for a more specialized option, there are options.

#### Booster Straps

These have been the go-to power strap for anyone looking for aftermarket power straps. Now that the Booster Strap patent has expired, we are seeing manufacturers making their own elastic power straps. But Booster still remains the king for a reason. Being the first to create and patent the elastic characteristics, Booster has had a long time to cement itself into the memory of those young and old. Still after years of use, sometimes the oldest straps are the best.

Booster straps combine their elasticity with the simplicity of a cam-style buckle that let's you cinch and tighten better than most available static straps. But not overdoing it is part of the battle too. Booster Straps are not fool proof and still need to be appropriately tightened but not overly tight.
