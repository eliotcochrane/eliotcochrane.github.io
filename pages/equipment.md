# My Equipment

## SKIS
####  HEAD e.SL FIS RD 165cm
####  Rossignol Hero Athlete GS 182cm

**Skinny skis on hard packed snow.** Those are the days of my dreams because they conjure the feelings of driving a race car. If I'm feeling like some speed, the long linking turns of the Rossignol Hero GS really throw me in feeling of an IndyCar at the Indianapolis 500. While the HEAD e.SL skis really feel like a Formula 1 car as they need the focus and physical ability to endure each and every turn.

#### Rossignol Black Ops Sender Ti (187cm)

This is the go-to crud ski that opened my eyes to a possible one quiver. It never left me exhausted and it never left me wanting much more. It was the perfect balance.
* Soft enough for skiing all day
* Stiff enough to hold on ice
* Wide enough for powder
* Easy to manage side cut
* Light enough to carry and hike

## BOOTS
#### HEAD Rapter WCR 4 (2022)

This boot changed my outlook on fit in a performance boot. After many years of custom fitting, this is the first where it all came together in one package. In 2022, the toe box had been expanded and during the 2021 season I was lucky to enough to test drive the boot a year early thanks to one of HEAD Japan's longest serving regional representative. Over two season a lot of the retention springs broke so the buckles are all loose, the stretch on the power strap is getting out of hand, and the outer heel piece of the inner liner is falling apart. But no matter how many times I look at other boots, I always come back to it with joy. It's my comfortable cobbled mess.
