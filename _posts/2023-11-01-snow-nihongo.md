## <center>Snow Nihongo</center>
### <center>Simple Japanese For The Slopes</center>

***

A ski trip to Japan is on the bucket list for millions of skiers all over the world. The culture, atmosphere, foods, and people make Japan a special place for people to visit. With a welcoming vibe and a culture that is like no other in the skiing world, Japan is the place to visit.

With Japanese resorts like Niseko, Hakuba, and Naeba taking the crown of "Most Recognized" ski resorts in Japan, these areas will likely have English speaking staff. But interacting with the locals in their native language is a good way to make new friends!

**Don't be intimidated!**

You can still enjoy Japan just as much as anyone else with their limited English and gestures! But a little bit of Japanese can go a long way. In this post, we will take a dip into the world of Japanese culture and the Japanese language on the ski hill. There are better guides for more travel centric phrases so we will focus on the on-mountain experience.

### Have Fun

When push comes to shove, the most important thing is to have fun. Not knowing Japanese is OK and you will have plenty of fun. Some things just have no borders.

But just like how the Japanese are friendly and kind, we should do that same for them. Saying 'please' (*arigatou*) and 'thank you' (*arigatou gozaimasu*) go a long way for you and those to come in the future.
