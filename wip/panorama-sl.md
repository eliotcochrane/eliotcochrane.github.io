***

Japan might take a lot of pride in producing some of then best ski demonstrators in the world, but they love their ski racing too. Like in other sports like F1 and golf, for example, ski racing too has it's own unique of fandom that comes out of Japan. Whether it be the maniacs that copy their favorite ski racer's setup to the smallest details or the old timers that never want to hang up their race suit, Japan has some of the most eccentric racing fans in the world.

Hosting the FIS Alpine World Championships in Shizukuishi during the 1992-1993 season certainly made an impact on the area. Banners still linger, hand-prints in bronze lay in the public for all to see in the capital of Morioka, and a fire continues for ski racing in the area.

Soon it was my turn to give it a go. I'm no stranger to the racing seen so when I got challenged by some of my Japanese skiing friends, I couldn't turn down the challenge.
