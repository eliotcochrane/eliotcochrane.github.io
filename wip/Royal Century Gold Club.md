## <center>Royal Century Golf Club</center>
### <center>Tranquility and Challenge</center>

***

Nestled in the mountains of Daisen in Akita Prefecture lies a golf course with a certain flair from another country and another generation. Separated from the cities and above the rice fields lies a course that doesn't feel very Japanese outside of the menu at lunch. While it may be polarizing in an economy that is steadily getting more and more difficult for a newer generation to start playing golf, Royal Century Golf Club maintains as best it can to have prime service and provide a great experience.

Described with a focus on strategically challenging Par 4's, distance alone is not going to reward you. This course touts rewarding players who boldly challenge the course while punishing players who back down. Trying to create a challenging tension of combining golfs aspects of sport and game to present a course that feels rewarding for those who step up to the challenge.

### Club House

Upon entering the grounds and approaching the club house, it tries to be very clear in the separation between the golf course and the entrance. With an entrance looking fit for a ski chalet or a bond villain, the course staff will take your bag from your vehicle and prepare it on the cart to be ready for you when you're ready to begin. With cobbled stones just in front, it does provide a different atmosphere. Especially when before entering the building there is a sign stating collared shirts and respectable pants/shorts are a must. I was the only person checking in that wasn't in their button down shirt (I got away with a polo shirt).

Upon going through the gateway, there is a long tunnel leading to a central room with a circular seating area. On the perimeter are different parts of the building from the locker rooms to the pro shop with a set of stairs leading to the dining room. Lining the walls are picturesque golf themed water color painting reprints (unfortunately none of them are based on RCGC). 

The locker rooms are extremely clean and the lockers themselves are exceptionally wide. Keys attached to the scorecard holder are a simple but effective way to keep your belongings locked as many places are replacing keys with electronic systems. In the case that you do need to lock your scorecard holder, there are available lockers to do so as well. Although, this isn't very popular as most of the time you will be carrying your scorecard anyways. Anything that you purchase on the grounds will be charged to your scorecard holder and locker number. Once the round is finished, there is an onsen for cleaning up before

Once you're ready to go and practice, there is another long tunnel opposite of the entrance that leads to the practice putting green. Reminiscent of an American football team or basketball team coming onto the field or court, the tunnel is long and littered with golf joke themed pictures along the way. Unfortunately they are reprints too. Just before exiting there are drinks and ice cream available for purchase. 

Outside in the starting area are all the carts and bags with the staff whipping them onto the carts and bringing them around. In each of the carts is also a customary bottle of cold tea for the especially hot day. Complete with plastic cups to reuse, this was a very welcome touch. I didn't feel the need to purchase any extra drinks. Aside from that, it was like any other golf cart. But that big Thermos bottle of cold tea isn't something I'll forget easily. That's good service and it gets refilled during lunch.

### Pre-Round

Before walking onto the practice green, it's always necessary to make a stop at the caddy window for a crisp scorecard,  fresh ball marker, and for this course, a brand new metal pitch fork! I've seen tons of courses that have branded plastic pitch forks, but this is the first course that I have seen that has branded metal pitch forks. I still have my trusty plastic pitch fork that I will use until it breaks, but the novelty of a metal pitch fork that was free is still going to be something that won't be easily forgotten. You don't see a branded metal pitch fork that is open for the taking. I still haven't used it yet so it might be the cheapest of the cheap.

As for the usual practice area, there is a putting green and also a range to warmup the longer clubs. Unfortunately I didn't know about the range until after I was done when I saw the signs on the way back to the clubhouse.

The main practice piece is the practice green. There is only one green with a small hill on one side to help practice breaking putts and pace up or down slopes. The grass on greens were pretty homogenous all the way from the practice green to the 18th.


### The Course

*Course Statistics*
| Tee | Distance (yds) | Course Rating | | Par |
| Forward Tee | 5139 | Men: 64.6 / Women: 69.0 | 72 |
| Competition Tee | 6834 | Men: 72.6 / 79.6 | 72 |

#### Tee Grounds

The tee grounds throughout the round were appropriately designed for the back tees. Unfortunately though, many of the forward tees were at a significant disadvantage by elevation changes in a country where the average age of golfers is significantly higher than in other countries. For many short distance players, the tees can present a challenge within themselves and may feel limiting. Also some of the tee locations, while being significantly forward, also did not have any of the mystique that the back tees did.

Aside from the layout, the tee boxes were also not as green and covered in grass as would be expected for such a price tag to play. ALso, many of the tee boxes did not have sand available for those that do take a divot, especially on Par 3's.

#### Fairways

This is where the course really shines. The fairways were spectacular. Of course there were past divots, but aside from that the fairways were smooth, cut cleanly, and a perfect height for the amateur golfer. None of the areas were cut extremely short or left extremely long due to imperfections in the terrain.

Each of the holes had a very clear separation from the fairway and the rough. Unfortunately, there was no second cut between the fairway and the rough but the quality of the fairway itself more than made up for this fact.

#### Rough

The following weekend was the club tournament for the members who wanted to take part in the club qualifier for the Iwate Prefectural Amateur Golf Tournament. For this, the grass was particularly longer than usual for a course in Japan. Japan tends to have relatively short rough compared to other countries as standard.

The grass was quite thick for amateurs and could have been significantly more intimating than usual for the average Japanese golfer. As a foreigner who is quite active, I found this rough to be quite easy to glide a club through. More often than not though, this produced fliers which made distance control an important decision when choosing clubs.

#### Bunker

As this is a more premium course,
#### Greens
#### Marking
but there were a surprising number of holes with slight damage. These being from excessive water pooling and sudden heating of said water. These are most likely left over from the previous season as it was a problem at many clubs around Tohoku.
