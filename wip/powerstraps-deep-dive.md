## <center>Deep Dive: Power Straps</center>
### <center>Response, Flex, and Support</center>

***

Often times power straps are the underdog when it comes to attention in ski boots. All of the attention is put towards things like the volume, closure system, or range-of-motion. Yet the power strap is one of the most critical elements to a ski boot with regards to fit, performance, and comfort. It's not just a mere fastener to be done along the way, it's one of the main conductors connecting you to your skis.

The power strap is an unassuming part of the ski boot but can contribute to transmitting power greater than many may expect. This band of material embodies function and form by still meeting aesthetics while still performing a vital function of transferring power from you to your skis through your ski boots. When we buckle our ski boots and tighten our power strap, we establish a connection with our gear, and in turn, the mountains.

### Importance

Precision and control are the ingredients necessary for your best sking and the strap plays a role in this symphony of a sport. The strap keeps your foot in the optimal position, allowing for the proper movements of your foot within the boot. Whether it's carving down iced up slopes or navigating endless powder fields, the power strap ensures that your movements are transmitted to the ski with finesse. 

Over the past 10 or so years, power straps have been getting the attention they deserve. After the introduction of the cam-style buckle to help leverage the tightening mechanism for a closer fit, power straps have been getting new features like improved materials, making them wider, or making different models geared towards the consumer and their needs.

### Customization and Comfort

The power strap sets itself apart by being able to adapt to your unique needs. In today's market, there are many different types of power straps, each with their own unique shape, features, and construction. Each of these mdoels are geared towards a particular skier and the needs that they need filled. This allows for fine tuning to be done to the boot by bootfitters around the world, whether you prefer a snug race-like boot setup or a relaxed fit for leisurely blue-bird days, power straps allow you to fine-tune the fit.



### Types

**Static**
This is the traditional view of what people think of when they hear 'power strap'. Static straps are as their name suggests, they do not stretch or deform under force or tension. Often times when older people see these straps, the first thing they think of is 'shin bang'. These types of straps were reknown for giving sore shins at the end of a long day but have stuck around for a multitude of reasons. The materials are much cheaper to produce and the return on performance is great. But just as ski sidecuts have changed over the years, the technology for power straps has changed too.
