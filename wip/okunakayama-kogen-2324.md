## <center>Local Bumps</center>

**CHOUMIN** is a series where Stray Lines will take a look into the smaller ski hills scattered around Japan. Choumin (町民) is roughly translates to citizen or local. With the idea of local people in mind, we hope to give you a little insight into the smaller places that often get overlooked as foreigners come to Japan to ski. While the bigger mountains do have their own appeal, the local hills often have an atmosphere that is hard to replicate anywhere else. Come along as we explore these little nuggets of gold.

Okunakayama is a modestly sized skiing area located in Ichinohe in the northern part of Iwate Prefecture. Almost one hour directly north of Morioka, this ski area can easily be accessed by car, lesser so by train and bus. But given it's proximity to much larger ski areas, it has been able to stay active and to keep slowly expanding every year.

Slowly but surely, Okunakayama continues to expand upon what is already available. Whether it be including tree runs, expanding them, purchasing new cross-country maintenance and race equipment, or creating more affordable options for local residents to keep them within the sport we all love.

### Borders

Okunakayama is quite northerly within Iwate Prefecture. While this limits customers from southern Iwate that may tend to ski at Geto Kogen Ski Resort, it does open the possibility for skiers and snowboarders from Aomori Prefecture to visit. The local skiers make up a majority of the population on the slopes but there are also lots of day passes and seasons passes sold to those outside the prefecture.

Many times, the passes sold to those outside the prefecture are often families from the military base that the United States of America operates in Misawa, Aomori Prefecture. They come to Okunakayama on the weekends as though it were just like home. English signage has increased within the ski area and the staff can also do their jobs in English. On top of that, there is also a military discount which acts as a great introduction for those looking to step their feet into snow sports for the first time.

### Beginner Tree Runs

Any look into the ski film industry that is in Japan and often times tree runs are at the forefront of the films. Some of them even being accessed just off the road! It's no wonder that even though the altitude might not be as high as some other countries, the back-country skiing scene keeps expanding every year as people experience tree runs and try to always get the first tracks. Many of them get their first taste of pow-pow at ski areas like Okunakayama.

Nearly five years ago, Okunakayama took the tree runs that they already had and cut many of the trees within the run and making it much easier to maneuver skis and also introduce others to powder skiing. Not only did they expand those runs, but they also made the mountain almost entirely tree run accessible with the exception of one spot leading to a river that doesn't have a proper exit. Anywhere you go, there will be tracks leading into the forest and exiting down below.

For many ski resorts, this would be unheard of because of the risks and insurance involved. But for Okunakayama this was one of the major selling points. Powder is not only accessible in a certain area. If you can find it, you can ski it.

### Around The Mountain

Dotting around the mountains are some great spots to visit. Even day travelers come just for these places. On each lift ticket, there is also a discount for one of the two places listed below. Let's take a look around the mountain and the surrounding area and see what there is to do.

Directly below the lain lodge is a gelato shop that is regularly visited in summer because of the beautiful views and the locally sourced ingredients. It is a small place but customers are regularly going in and out. Of course, the standard flavors of vanilla and chocolate are great, but some of the rotating flavors are just as delicious if not more! My favorite is the sesame flavor (goma - ごま)!

Be sure to give them a look and get your 50円 discount!

##### Oknakakayama Kogen Onsen - 奥中山高原温泉

Right next to the ice cream place is a nice onsen. Like most onsens that have been around a while, it isn't the prettiest onsen but it has a great atmosphere
