## <center>Tohoku Spring Skiing</center>
### <center>Still Skiing Into May</center>

***

It's no contest that the peak season to come to Japan for skiing is in late January and early February. The snow is almost always falling and usually the snow just doesn't stop building up. We see it on local TV and interviewers descend on ski resorts all over Japan to interview foreigners who have made the trip to Japan. This year the media was especially focused on the prices of ramen at some of these resorts.

But for a different experience, spring is just as memorable as the deep powder. The skiing may feel a little different but you can walk away with some experiences that you can't do in the heart of winter. With some areas having cherry blossoms in bloom in the valley and snow resorts open in the mountains, you can really enjoy the best of both worlds to fill your journey of Japanese snow culture and spring festivities.

### Japanese Spring Corn

While many of the smaller areas do close around the end of March and the beginning of April, within Tohoku there are a few places that do stay open all the way into May. Many of the skiers from the smaller hills feed into the bigger resorts that have snow until May. These slopes become flooded with skiers and many of whom are only spring skiers to avoid the cold.

These warm days mean soft snow that clumps into granules. Some of the locals affectionately call it "corn skiing" because of how large these granules can actually become! Corn skiing gives the best of all types of snow.

### Cherry Blossoms

Cherry blossoms have been a part of the Japanese culture for centuries and continue to be so. To this day, things like the academic schedule and new hiring schedule still revolve around April because of it's timing with cherry blossoms. Cherry trees are also a gesture of good faith and are often exchanged between foreign countries and Japan.

In addition to their cultural significance, they are just simply beautiful. Some of the famous areas that will be listed later on will often times we covered in pink foliage. In severely windy conditions, it can feel like a pink blizzard as the cherry blossoms fall from the trees. It is truly a spectacular sight and feels like a movie scene.

### Ski and Cherry Blossom Spots

The resort only has 1 lift feeding into 2 trails but it is a hotspot for teams looking to get some pole training, back country skiers looking to explore the mountains a little more, and the onsen enthusiast that visits the nearby onsens!
