## <center>Tohoku Spring Skiing</center>
### <center>Still Skiing Into May</center>

***

It's no contest that the peak season to come to Japan for skiing is in late January and early February. The snow is almost always falling and usually the snow just doesn't stop building up. We see it on local TV and interviewers descend on ski resorts all over Japan to interview foreigners who have made the trip to Japan. This year the media was especially focused on the prices of ramen at some of these resorts.

But for a different experience, spring is just as memorable as the deep powder. The skiing may feel a little different but you can walk away with some experiences that you can't do in the heart of winter. With some areas having cherry blossoms in bloom in the valley and snow resorts open in the mountains, you can really enjoy the best of both worlds to fill your journey of Japanese snow culture and spring festivities.

#### Japanese Spring "Beans"

While many of the smaller areas do close around the end of March and the beginning of April, within Tohoku there are a few places that do stay open all the way into May. Many of the skiers from the smaller hills feed into the bigger resorts that have snow until May. These slopes become flooded with skiers and many of whom are only spring skiers to avoid the cold.

These warm days mean soft snow that clumps into granules. Some of the locals affectionately call it "bean skiing" because of how large these granules can actually become! In the United States, I can remember it commonly being referred to as "corn skiing". Things are the same world wide.

Bringing the level of control of hard packed snow but the softness of powder. It strikes a balance that is easy for beginners to learn to ski on, good for intermediate skiers to experience new terrain, and expert skiers to challenge themselves in new ways.

### Some Things To Do
#### Cherry Blossoms

Cherry blossoms have been a part of the Japanese culture for centuries and continue to be so. To this day, things like the academic schedule and new hiring schedule still revolve around April because of it's timing with cherry blossoms. Cherry trees are also a gesture of good faith and are often exchanged between foreign countries and Japan.

In addition to their cultural significance, they are just simply beautiful. Some of the famous areas that will be listed later on will often times we covered in pink foliage. In severely windy conditions, it can feel like a pink blizzard as the cherry blossoms fall from the trees. It is truly a spectacular sight and feels like a movie scene.

#### Local Events

Various towns will also have weekly events that may have suspended in the winter but begin again in the spring and finish in the fall. These can feel like flea markets or farmers markets where local vendors will sell their goods. In addition to that, food vendors will also come to sell food and drinks.

Within Iwate, the most popular is most likely *Yoichi* in Morioka, Iwate. This is every Saturday once the temperature begins to rise, often times beginning in April. Here, of course the local mom and pop vendors have their stalls selling everything from fruits and vegetables to used kimonos. Sometimes it is interesting just to see what people are selling and sometimes more interesting is who will buy it. Food vendors also join in the fun to help boost their own business. But the main vendor is the local beer, Baeren Brewery. Baeren Brewery has cheap beer that is given in a plastic cup branded with the brewery seal. One you are finished, you can return the plastic cup for a 100å†† return.

#### Explore Japanese Folklore/History

More often than not, the local events and cherry blossoms will be exhibited in spots that have meaning. Natural occurrences like cherry blossoms often influence the local life. All of these take different forms.

Castles are the biggest draw in terms of festivals. Castles are often lined with cherry trees so the springtime views are often very stunning. Within the courtyard of these castles and along the outer walls, tons of food stalls will be there selling food. Some areas with bodies of water around the castle also have boats for rent that are a big hit with couples.
