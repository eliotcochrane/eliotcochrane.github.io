Nature is a source of awe and beauty and acts as a natural compass for us. We all know the benefits of walking and hiking and as golfers, we can appreciate a nice walk in the woods. It is integral and almost a tradition in our sport. This natural instinct that brings a calming effect to us is possibly why we come back again and again to the golf course.

Nature can be beautiful, and nature can be deadly. Natural disasters are common after natural hazards around the world. Common to North America are tornados, wildfires, floods, and droughts. During these times, countless lives are lost and millions to billions of dollars are lost in the event. For Japan, typhoons, landslides, and blizzards are some hazards that happen and make news. But the biggest natural hazards that have left indelible marks on Japan are earthquakes and tsunamis.

### History Time

Yuda Kogen Country Club was opened July 17th, 1994 and was a shining beacon to the local area. Hoping to bring more tourism and money to the area, the 18 hole course was designed to be built during the end of the Japanese Economic Bubble of the 1980s into the 1990s. During this time, the Japanese economy had prices for real estate and stock markets going out of control. Assets were greatly inflated in value and people had their salaries double or triple year over year. This lead to the regular person having more expandable income.

This is when leisure sports started to boom in Japan. Golf of course taking center stage around Japan, many courses were built to capitalize upon it, including Yuda Kogen Country Club. Built in the mountains of, at the time, Yuda, it was a beautiful course that had a large and beautiful clubhouse that overlooked the trees leading up to the mountains on all sides.

### Club Setbacks

Upon completion of the Yuda Kogen Country Club, the membership fee was about 700,000円, roughly about $70,000, so it was a great spot for those who had money to burn, and the area was filled with places to stay for those who came from far away. But Yuda Kogen CC was opened during the downturn of the Japanese Economic Bubble. Membership was low, and the income model had to be altered. The membership fee stayed the same, but visitors were free to arrange a tee time at a one-time exorbitant price. Even this was not enough as year after year things were cut back. These financial setbacks kept pushing Yuda further and further back.

Then came 2011...

The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake happened on March 11th, 2011. The devastation of the golf course that resulted in its sale to the current owner. A magnitude 9.0 earthquake was recorded in the Pacific Ocean. The earthquake caused a massive tsunami that the world saw on TV. Large waves crashing into towns, cities, and lives and then retreated out to sea with all it destroyed along with it. The coastline was devastated, livelihoods were crushed, and lives were taken. Even inland the damage was severe. Many places without electricity for days or weeks, all while snow is still snowing in some areas.

The earthquake shook the building so much that the main clubhouse became unusable. Cracks in the foundation and structural pillars meant it needed to be rebuilt from the ground up. The owners had to sell to the current owners and the former caddy shack was reconstructed to serve as the clubhouse. The remains of the original clubhouse still remain as the club still uses the first floor of the lobby and entrance to store a portion of the golf carts during strong weather.

### Clubhouse

The current clubhouse used to be the caddy shack. Now it has been turned into the clubhouse and is easy to navigate. The first floor is reception, dining area, and bathroom. On the second floor are locker rooms separated by gender. It is small but functional to check in and get started.

### Pre-Round

#### Practice Greens

There are two practice greens on the golf course. The first is located behind the old clubhouse next to the tee ground on #1 and is a slope to flat green on one side. The other is located behind the current clubhouse right above the tee on #10 and is a sloping green but mimicking a two tier green.

Setting up expectations for the rest of the course, the practice greens are not in the best condition. The putting green next to the Hole #1 tee ground is nearly all dead. Whether from sun, lack of water, or water shedding, the green is nearly all gone. The practice green above Hole #10 is mostly intact with a few patches around the edges that are dead.

Don't expect too much.
