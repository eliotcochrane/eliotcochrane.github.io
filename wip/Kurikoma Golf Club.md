***

Nestled in the mountains of Daisen in Akita Prefecture lies a golf course with a certain flair from another country and another generation. Separated from the cities and above the rice fields lies a course that doesn't feel very Japanese outside of the menu at lunch. While it may be polarizing in an economy that is steadily getting more and more difficult for a newer generation to start playing golf, Royal Century Golf Club maintains as best it can to have prime service and provide a great experience.

Described with a focus on strategically challenging Par 4's, distance alone is not going to reward you. This course touts rewarding players who boldly challenge the course while punishing players who back down. Trying to create a challenging tension of combining golfs aspects of sport and game to present a course that feels rewarding for those who step up to the challenge.
