## <center>Local Bumps</center>

**CHOUMIN** is a series where Stray Lines will take a look into the smaller ski hills scattered around Japan. Choumin (町民) is roughly translates to citizen or local. With the idea of local people in mind, we hope to give you a little insight into the smaller places that often get overlooked as foreigners come to Japan to ski. While the bigger mountains do have their own appeal, the local hills often have an atmosphere that is hard to replicate anywhere else. Come along as we explore these little nuggets of gold.

Starting in 2024, Appi Kogen Resort is having a great season. While the start of the season and even the start of the mid-season has been tough. Appi Kogen Resort has been able to give skiers the chance to ski in an area where many ski areas are still covered with a light dusting of snow.

Nestled into the Hachimantai mountains splitting Akita Prefecture and Iwate Prefecture, Appi Kogen Resort gets a consistent coating of snow throughout the winter season. This season has been marked by lower than normal snowfall but that has not stopped Appi from opening as usual year after year around the beginning of December.

### Differing From The Competition
#### Preparation Started In 2023

At the end of the '22/'23 season, Appi was having a great season as the spring skiing was in swing. At the same time, many of the regular pass holders and those following Appi on social media got a flyer looking forward to the next year.

Appi Kogen Resorts Season's Pass Early Bird Discount... the price? **29,000円**

It's clear that a lot of people bought it because the slopes have been packed weekend and weekend. Even with the little snow cover during the early part of the season, people still came to ski. Something must have looked very enticing in their finances to justify such a low season's pass. But so far the reception has been utter disbelieve that even in a year with little snow, Appi has more than enough snow cover when many other ski areas are struggling to get the slopes looking white.

### Quality Over Quantity
#### Iwate Resorts Rivalry For Business

It's no secret that Geto Kogen Ski Resort has been making leaps and bounds with its marketing. And it's clear to see why when their website and social accounts flaunt endless powder with family-friendly amenities. But when powder is the only thing going for them as a resort, it leaves other things to be desired when Appi steps in.

Appi has had many great powder days this season in addition to the great work that the hard work that trail groomer's put into their work. Time and time again, the Appi ski slope has been prepared to great lengths every day built upon a hard base that this warm winter gave us early on. Taking advantage of the opportunity, the snow grooming crew at Appi Kogen Ski Resort have for sure earned their fair share when it comes to recognition for making Appi Kogen Ski Resort an amazing place to ski and snowboard.

### Foreign Influence
#### More English than Japanese?

Over the span of almost 10 years, Appi Kogen Ski Resort has changed ownership, changed customer focus, and brought in more foreign-friendly access. Starting with the ownership change to Asia Gate Group which put Appi Kogen Ski Resort under the umbrella of Kamori Kanko Group, changes started to happen with the lift management situation. It was clear that they were starting to shake up business and not just do the same. Year upon year, which lifts would open and close felt dependent on the higher-ups. IC Tickets were placed all over the mountain and then in subsequent years were partially removed around other parts of the mountain. The direction was all over the place.

Then there was an influx of Asian customers to stay at the hotel. Anytime the hotel buffet was open, there were sure to be rows and rows of foreign customers from other Asian countries. It sure did bring a lot of money to Appi Kogen Ski Resort and they looked to expand outside of just the Asian market. This time they decided to build an even bigger facility!

In late 2022, the Harrow International School Appi Japan was built. It is a massive facility that sits adjacent to the Appi Kogen Country Club and train station at the foot of the mountain looking up to the Appi Kogen Ski Resort. Here students have plenty of access to the mountains, the teachers and their families are continually skiing, and general interest in the area has grown within the foreign communities in the surrounding prefectures.

To house many of the foreign guests, a new hotel branded by ANA was built next to the previous Appi Grand Hotel and adjacent to the super-quad at the bottom of the mountain. The ANA InterContinental Appi Kogen Resort exhibits some luxury standards that aren't commonly seen in the region. Being a 5-star luxury resort

All of this culminates with the Appi Kogen Ski Resort providing great access for those visiting regardless of their language or country of origin.

### What's Next For Appi?

Currently, the Harrow International School Appi Japan is looking to increase their student body size and will be continually growing year upon year. Specifically, they are looking for local Iwate students to give their international students a more localized experience and to expand the capabilities of students from within Iwate. This will be good to attract more foreign business and tourism to the resort and the area.

Appi Kogen Ski Resort has also expanded some facilities like its snow park to include bigger jumps, rails, and boxes easily accessible from the bottom super-quad. But it's not clear if they are going to host events related to freestyle or not.

Currently, it looks like Appi Kogen Ski Resort is most interested in bringing in foreign visitors. First and foremost, it is a business. The Japanese ski and snowboard population has been declining for years even amongst some of the best skiing conditions in the world. Hopefully, their incredible season pass value can entice the local population to come and enjoy the wonderful slopes that they have to offer.
