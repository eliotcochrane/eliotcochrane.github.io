## <center>Royal Century Golf Club</center>
### <center>Tranquility and Challenge</center>

***

Nestled in the mountains of Daisen in Akita Prefecture lies a golf course with a certain flair from another country and another generation. Separated from the cities and above the rice fields lies a course that doesn't feel very Japanese outside of the menu at lunch. While it may be polarizing in an economy that is steadily getting more and more difficult for a newer generation to start playing golf, Royal Century Golf Club maintains as best it can to have prime service and provide a great experience.

Described with a focus on strategically challenging Par 4's, distance alone is not going to reward you. This course touts rewarding players who boldly challenge the course while punishing players who back down. Trying to create a challenging tension of combining golfs aspects of sport and game to present a course that feels rewarding for those who step up to the challenge.

### Club House

Upon entering the grounds and approaching the club house, it tries to be very clear in the separation between the golf course and the entrance. With an entrance looking fit for a ski chalet or a bond villain, the course staff will take your bag from your vehicle and prepare it on the cart to be ready for you when you're ready to begin. With cobbled stones just in front, it does provide a different atmosphere. Especially when before entering the building there is a sign stating collared shirts and respectable pants/shorts are a must. I was the only person checking in that wasn't in their button down shirt (I got away with a polo shirt).

Upon going through the gateway, there is a long tunnel leading to a central room with a circular seating area. On the perimeter are different parts of the building from the locker rooms to the pro shop with a set of stairs leading to the dining room. Lining the walls are picturesque golf themed water color painting reprints (unfortunately none of them are based on RCGC). 

The locker rooms are extremely clean and the lockers themselves are exceptionally wide. Keys attached to the scorecard holder are a simple but effective way to keep your belongings locked as many places are replacing keys with electronic systems. In the case that you do need to lock your scorecard holder, there are available lockers to do so as well. Although, this isn't very popular as most of the time you will be carrying your scorecard anyways. Anything that you purchase on the grounds will be charged to your scorecard holder and locker number. Once the round is finished, there is an onsen for cleaning up before

Once you're ready to go and practice, there is another long tunnel opposite of the entrance that leads to the practice putting green. Reminiscent of an American football team or basketball team coming onto the field or court, the tunnel is long and littered with golf joke themed pictures along the way. Unfortunately they are reprints too. Just before exiting there are drinks and ice cream available for purchase. 

Outside in the starting area are all the carts and bags with the staff whipping them onto the carts and bringing them around. In each of the carts is also a customary bottle of cold tea for the especially hot day. Complete with plastic cups to reuse, this was a very welcome touch. I didn't feel the need to purchase any extra drinks. Aside from that, it was like any other golf cart. But that big Thermos bottle of cold tea isn't something I'll forget easily. That's good service and it gets refilled during lunch.

### Pre-Round

Before walking onto the practice green, it's always necessary to make a stop at the caddy window for a crisp scorecard,  fresh ball marker, and for this course, a brand new metal pitch fork! I've seen tons of courses that have branded plastic pitch forks, but this is the first course that I have seen that has branded metal pitch forks. I still have my trusty plastic pitch fork that I will use until it breaks, but the novelty of a metal pitch fork that was free is still going to be something that won't be easily forgotten. You don't see a branded metal pitch fork that is open for the taking. I still haven't used it yet so it might be the cheapest of the cheap.

As for the usual practice area, there is a putting green and also a range to warmup the longer clubs. Unfortunately I didn't know about the range until after I was done when I saw the signs on the way back to the clubhouse.

The main practice piece is the practice green. There is only one green with a small hill on one side to help practice breaking putts and pace up or down slopes. The grass on greens were pretty homogenous all the way from the practice green to the 18th.


### The Course

*Course Statistics*
| Tee | Distance (yds) | Course Rating | | Par |
| Forward Tee | 5139 | Men: 64.6 / Women: 69.0 | 72 |
| Competition Tee | 6834 | Men: 72.6 / 79.6 | 72 |

#### Tee Grounds

The tee grounds throughout the round were appropriately designed for the back tees. Unfortunately though, many of the forward tees were at a significant disadvantage by elevation changes in a country where the average age of golfers is significantly higher than in other countries. For many short distance players, the tees can present a challenge within themselves and may feel limiting. Also some of the tee locations, while being significantly forward, also did not have any of the mystique that the back tees did.

Aside from the layout, the tee boxes were also not as green and covered in grass as would be expected for such a price tag to play. ALso, many of the tee boxes did not have sand available for those that do take a divot, especially on Par 3's.

#### Fairways

This is where the course really shines. The fairways were spectacular. Of course there were past divots, but aside from that the fairways were smooth, cut cleanly, and a perfect height for the amateur golfer. None of the areas were cut extremely short or left extremely long due to imperfections in the terrain.

Each of the holes had a very clear separation from the fairway and the rough. Unfortunately, there was no second cut between the fairway and the rough but the quality of the fairway itself more than made up for this fact.

#### Rough

The following weekend was the club tournament for the members who wanted to take part in the club qualifier for the yearly club championship at the end of the month. For this, the grass was particularly longer than usual for a course in Japan. Japan tends to have relatively short rough compared to other countries as standard.

The grass was quite thick for amateurs and could have been significantly more intimating than usual for the average Japanese golfer. As a foreigner who is quite active, I found this rough to be quite easy to glide a club through. More often than not though, this produced fliers which made distance control an important decision when choosing clubs.

#### Bunker

As this is a more premium course, the bunkers are properly prepared. The edges of the bunkers are relatively clear and cut well. Most likely with the club championship qualifier being that weekend. Each of the bunker shapes is also pleasing to the eye but often times in tricky positions for those with shorter club distances.

The sand within the bunkers was quite different from what I was expecting. Often times many areas will get sand that is as bright as they can find. Many other courses go for the sand that is typically found on the televised tournaments. Yet the Royal Century Golf Club has sand that is larger granules and also speckled with black sand. It's smooth like find sand  but the larger granules prevent the club from possibly sticking. It's great for amateurs who might not be as willing to open the face of the club and show the bunker some bounce. It was a new sand for me but I was pleasantly surprised.

#### Greens

The greens had definitely seen better days. Many of the edges of the green were plucked and switched with parts of the center of the green to keep coverage of the green. Without any plug switches the grass would be a little bit sparse. On top of that the pitch marks were plentiful with no one repairing them and dead patches on almost every green.

To make things even worse, parts of the green were fully dead. These areas being from excessive water pooling and sudden heating of any pooled water. A variety of reasons could be as to why but I don't want to speculate the situation. These dead patches are most likely left over from the previous season as it was a problem at many clubs around Tohoku.

The size of the greens themselves was quite comparable to greens at other large clubs and the green speed matched the practice greens comparably. The undulations, elevation changes, and overall ball rolling shape was easy to read and predict. Not to say that the greens were easy, but that they weren't trying to trick you with any vision trickery like some other courses might do.

#### Marking

Be prepared for no distance markers. All other signage is appropriate and easy to see and understand. Out of bounds, hazards, and penalty areas are all clearly marked. Everything is OK, except for your relation to the hole. To put it clearly, there were no yardage markers aside from the tee to hole yardage sign on the tee ground. 

This was greatly infuriating as I had to be reliant on my rangefinder. On the market, there are many other great devices to see your position on the goal relative to the hole, but many of those devices are aimed at a North American or European market and do not have lesser known courses in Asia mapped. Be prepared with a rangefinder and an extra battery (just in case, you never know...).

### Lunch Break

After the first 9 holes, there is a mandatory lunch break. After clearing your shoe soles of dirt and debris as well as the basic cleaning with a wet and dry cloth, your free to head to the dining room. Inside you will be seated by a waiter or waitress with water soon on the way.

The menu isn't as extensive as high end restaurants because they are serving a smaller market, but the menu at Royal Century GC was more than enough to satisfy anyone. With foods ranging from hot to cold and vegetable heavy to meat heavy foods, they have enough choice to help fuel you for the next 9 holes.

The service was excellent and the time from food orders to served on the table was surprisingly fast. This matched with their ample lunch break schedule of about 45 minutes, meant you had a lot of time to eat, drink, and talk amongst your group. Upon your return to the cart, your complimentary tea will be refilled and your used cups taken and replaced with me cleaned cups in a plastic sleeve.

Now you're ready to take on the next 9 holes!

### Post Round

After the round, upon returning the cart to the club house you will claim your things and also check that all of your clubs are present and not forgotten somewhere on the course. After checking you have all of your belongings, you may return to the club house for a post round onsen bath.

The bath is free and towels are free to use but not take home. Many people will bring a change of clothes but if you have the same clothes it is OK too. Here you may use the onsen just a though it were a regular onsen. Be courteous and clean when you use the onsen bath.

### Overall Experience

The Royal Century Golf Club is a step above other places but also falls behind in others. The service is great, amenities are fantastic, and the course layout and design are great. But poor maintenance over the years in places like the tee grounds and greens leave some of the most important areas left to be desired. The core experience is the course itself and sometimes it left a bad taste in my mouth from lack of grass on some tee boxes and dead spots located on some greens with plug holes surrounding some greens so as to rehabilitate the green.

But overall, I was pleasantly surprised and had an overall great experience. Don't forget to bring a rangefinder and also a nice set of clothes to wear to the course! WIth the right friends, any of the shortcomings will be soon forgotten.
