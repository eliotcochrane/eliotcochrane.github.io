## <center>Badge Test</center>
### <center>Practical Examinations to Test Ski Abilities</center>

***

As we all seek to get better and progress our skiing abilities, it becomes hard to gauge what we need to improve and how we can become better skiers. Japan is one of the leading countries when it comes to their demonstration skiing prowess. It leads to a country of relatively good skiers from a country without a long history of success on the World Cup for ski racing.

This comes from the directive of the Ski Association of Japan (SAJ). SAJ has been seeking out it's best skiers within the country, studying their skiing, comparing it to the European styles, and creating themes or programs to encourage people to get out and learn something new about skiing. Many times this is a trickle down effect starting from the national demonstration team, to the instructors, and then to the individuals within the sport.

We'll take a look at a level of the skiing practicals that is a healthy base to which skiers can choose their own adventure of going the instructor route or taking the demonstration competition route.

### Levels & Beyond!

The levels start from 5 and continue to 1

| Level | Requirements |
| ----- | ----- |
| 5級 | - Snowplow in a controlled manner |
| 4級 | - Snowplow in a controlled manner (w/ rhythm changes) |
| 3級 | - Basic parallel ski turn <br> - Stem turn (easy terrain) |
| 2級 | - Parallel long turns <br> - Parallel short turns <br> - Steam turn (natural terrain) |
| 1級 | - Parallel long turns <br> - Parallel short turns <br> - General skiing (varied radii turns) <br> - Parallel short turns (uneven terrain, bumps/moguls)

From this stage once you pass your 1st Level Exam (1級), you can branch out into two differing paths. One being the instructor route where you will work and study to become proficient in what to teach, how to teach, and build a love for skiing within students.

Or you can continue down the demonstration skiing rabbit hole and go for the Technical Prize and the Crown Prize levels of skiing. The test is nearly identical to the 1st Level Exam (1級) but the points required to pass are much higher. Each event you are given a max of 100 points.

| Level | Requirements |
| ----- | ----- |
| Technical Prize | - Score over 300 points over 4 events |
| Crown Prize | - Score over 320 points over 4 events |

### Taking The Test (1級)

#### Day 1 - Lesson (Required)

The day started with checking in to the ski school. The first thing was to check my previous badge level (2nd Level) and pay for today's lesson about the material for tomorrow. This is a mandatory lesson required starting for the 1st Level Exam. Anything prior did not need a lesson. From here we gathered at the bottom of the lift, broke up into groups, and went to the top to see where we would go and what we would do.

Upon arriving at the top we were herded down to the starting point for the long turns and general skiing course, each of the participants going down one by one for direct advice from one of the instructors. Following this, we moved further down to a steep part which consisted of the short turns. Here too we went down one by one getting advice on what is expected and how we can improve. Followed by the moguls a little further down the mountain. The moguls seemed a bane to most people as instead of the slightly smaller bumps in the example videos from SAJ, the moguls were deep, icy, and roughed up.

Once the two hours from 10:00 to 12:00 were finished, you were free to go and practice or go home. I had other things to do so I went home.

#### Day 2 - Exam

Just like the day before, we all herded around the lift at 10:00 and went up the lift together. This time there was no practice, no inspection of the snow we'll be skiing, and no fore-runner to show the level of skiing required and also where to stop. To make it that little bit more difficult, the night before we had just received a nice 10cm of snow and the course to be used was not groomed.

Let the games begin...

1. Long Parallel Turns
2. General Skiing Technique
3. Short Parallel Turns
4. Short Parallel Turns (Uneven Terrain)

One by one, we went down the flagged course with a start and a finish. All the while being judged by three ski school instructors. To keep everyone's spirits bright, the starter official and I started banter that slowly spread throughout the top groups. By the end of it, we were cheering on each other at the start and congratulating each other as we finished.

Once all of the stages were completed, a debrief was given at the bottom of the last stage. These were comments for those that maybe didn't pass but needed some advice when looking to pass the exam the last time. Most of the advice was to get forward regardless of the situation and be more dynamic between turns. This was pretty evident as many of the examinees were in the backseat and trying not to let their bad habits show by being overly stiff throughout the exam.

The exam ended at 12:30 but the results would be posted around 2:30 in front of the ski school. This time the pass percentage was far fewer than I was expecting. I had a feeling that some of the other participants would have a problem but I was not imagining that even some former racers with good results during high school would struggle and fail the exam. I feel glad to have passed even though I was so nonchalant in front of obviously nervous examinees.

### Value

It's hard to gauge the impact of the badge system on the majority of the skiing population. Starting in the 1970's, the skiing population placed a lot of credibility on the badge test. While in America there are skiing certifications, most of these are geared towards to-be instructors. Yet talking to any older skier in Japan and the first thing they ask is "Do you have a licenses?"

Nowadays, though, the badge test is relegated to those that want to join the National Demonstration Competition Qualifier. Often times they are the ski racers that finally said "It's time to hang up the race suit." and then turn the page on a new style of skiing in their life.

Does it create a carrot-on-a-stick for some people to improve? Yes, without a doubt. 
Does the regular person really care that much? No.

We each have our own way of skiing that suits our body. There are certainly some key aspects to take away like outside ski pressuring, center of mass management, and edge control. These are things that make skiing unique to each of us and influences why or why not we may choose some equipment over another. Like golf, no two swings are the same and neither are any two turns the same. Even on a race course, the very same turn is different for every athlete. So to are our bodies and our connections to the skis and snow.

So the regular skier that goes out five to ten days a year has no need to even think about this. They are out there for fun and not grinding for a silly pin and a piece of paper. It has it's purpose but never let it take the fun out of skiing.
