Nature is a source of awe and beauty and acts as a natural compass for us. We all know the benefits of walking and hiking and as golfers, we can appreciate a nice walk in the woods. It is integral and almost a tradition in our sport. This natural instinct that brings a calming effect to us is possibly why we come back again and again to the golf course.

Nature can be beautiful, and nature can be deadly. Natural disasters are common after natural hazards around the world. Common to North America are tornados, wildfires, floods, and droughts. During these times, countless lives are lost and millions to billions of dollars are lost in the event. For Japan, typhoons, landslides, and blizzards are some hazards that happen and make news. But the biggest natural hazards that have left indelible marks on Japan are earthquakes and tsunamis.

### History Time

Yuda Kogen Country Club was opened July 17th, 1994 and was a shining beacon to the local area. Hoping to bring more tourism and money to the area, the 18 hole course was designed to be built during the end of the Japanese Economic Bubble of the 1980s into the 1990s. During this time, the Japanese economy had prices for real estate and stock markets going out of control. Assets were greatly inflated in value and people had their salaries double or triple year over year. This lead to the regular person having more expandable income.

This is when leisure sports started to boom in Japan. Golf of course taking center stage around Japan, many courses were built to capitalize upon it, including Yuda Kogen Country Club. Built in the mountains of, at the time, Yuda, it was a beautiful course that had a large and beautiful clubhouse that overlooked the trees leading up to the mountains on all sides.

### Club Setbacks

Upon completion of the Yuda Kogen Country Club, the membership fee was about 700,000円, roughly about $70,000, so it was a great spot for those who had money to burn, and the area was filled with places to stay for those who came from far away. But Yuda Kogen CC was opened during the downturn of the Japanese Economic Bubble. Membership was low, and the income model had to be altered. The membership fee stayed the same, but visitors were free to arrange a tee time at a one-time exorbitant price. Even this was not enough as year after year things were cut back. These financial setbacks kept pushing Yuda further and further back.

Then came 2011...

The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake happened on March 11th, 2011. The devastation of the golf course that resulted in its sale to the current owner. A magnitude 9.0 earthquake was recorded in the Pacific Ocean. The earthquake caused a massive tsunami that the world saw on TV. Large waves crashing into towns, cities, and lives and then retreated out to sea with all it destroyed along with it. The coastline was devastated, livelihoods were crushed, and lives were taken. Even inland the damage was severe. Many places without electricity for days or weeks, all while snow is still snowing in some areas.

The earthquake shook the building so much that the main clubhouse became unusable. Cracks in the foundation and structural pillars meant it needed to be rebuilt from the ground up. The owners had to sell to the current owners and the former caddy shack was reconstructed to serve as the clubhouse. The remains of the original clubhouse still remain as the club still uses the first floor of the lobby and entrance to store a portion of the golf carts during strong weather.

### Clubhouse

The current clubhouse used to be the caddy shack. Now it has been turned into the clubhouse and is easy to navigate. The first floor is reception, dining area, and bathroom. On the second floor are locker rooms separated by gender. It is small but functional to check in and get started.

### Pre-Round

#### Practice Greens

There are two practice greens on the golf course. The first is located behind the old clubhouse next to the tee ground on #1 and is a slope to flat green on one side. The other is located behind the current clubhouse right above the tee on #10 and is a sloping green but mimicking a two tier green.

Setting up expectations for the rest of the course, the practice greens are not in the best condition. The putting green next to the Hole #1 tee ground is nearly all dead. Whether from sun, lack of water, or water shedding, the green is nearly all gone. The practice green above Hole #10 is mostly intact with a few patches around the edges that are dead.

Don't expect too much.

### The Course

WIP

*Course Statistics*
| Tee | Distance (yds) | Course Rating | Par |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ladies | 5218 | 66.5 | 72 |
| Front | 5842 | 69.3 | 72 |
| Regular | 6208 | 70.9 | 72 |
| Back | 6609 | 72.8 | 72 |

#### Tee Grounds

Tee grounds are a little bumpy all over the course. There are a few areas where there is no grass and instead lies a turf mat to help keep dirt and new seed in place. For the most part though, any situation other than a par 3 will be no problem.

Former competition tees have been demolished and to be used to clean up the back and regular tees. Prior to this there were some waves within most tee boxes due to heavy rains and earthquakes just generally moving the earth. Tee boxes have great placement to not feel at a disadvantage. Even the front tees are appropriately placed giving the course a rounded feel regardless of which tee you play from.

#### Fairways

This is where it starts to become a hit or miss scenario. There are a few fairways, especially the higher elevated fairways, that are nice and firm and are usually open for carts to drive on. Other fairways are perpetually pooling water and killing grass in areas. And lastly, there are the areas where it's a pick of the draw to see if you will land in mud or on a firm fairway.

As for the shaping at complexity, they have been tamed back over the years. Former bunkers are now just rounded out banks and various trees have been greatly trimmed back or removed. Most of the holes have a slight bowl shape to help the ball stay in the fairway, but a severely offline ball will not return to the fairway but instead stay in the rough.

#### Rough

The rough is also hit or miss depending on the moisture content of the ground beneath it. The more dry spots have quite surprisingly low-cut rough, almost perfect for an amateur because it feels like teeing the ball up again. This is pretty common in Japan and is always a little mind-boggling to not feel like a slight penalty but as an amateur, I appreciate it very much.

Then you have the swamps that the club doesn't want to ruin by running the machines over. These are where the water run-off is pretty poor and pools up. With the club not wanting to ruin the ground beneath it, the grass gets to the length of a grip at times.

#### Bunkers

Bunkers do not get enough love from the grounds crew at many golf courses. Yuda Kogen CC takes it to a whole new level. This year they recently put in new sand, but it is filled with rocks and pebbles. I'm sure that most golfers know the horror of hitting a rock between your club and the golf ball.

In addition to the poor homogeneity, the bunkers are also not spread easily. Of course, rainstorm after rainstorm, the sand will eventually travel to the lowest point within the bunker, but in most of the bunkers the center was 8〜10cm deep of nice sand while anything towards the edges has 2〜4cm with a majority of rocks scattered towards the outside.

It's not uncommon for some casual players to just take their ball out of the bunker and place it behind the bunker along the same theoretical straight line to the pin. Of course, within their own group rules.

#### Greens

The greens are a real Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde parallel. Within the original story by Robert Louis Stevenson, Dr. Jekyll discovers a way to split his own personality between bad and good. Yuda Kogen CC almost has a similar feeling with their greens.

Somehow they managed to make their green on the OUT course almost nearly dead. While the IN course is nearly all vibrant and only minor damage on the fringes. It is frustrating but for the price and the known financial problems the course has had,
