## <center>First Day Back</center>
### <center>Building A Foundation For The Season</center>

***

Ski areas across Japan are starting to open regardless of the El Ni√±o climate pattern projected for the season. With ski openings comes the annual first day back on the slopes. These first few days back on the slopes are the most dangerous for even the most seasoned skiers. It makes sense that even at the World Cup level, they too take their first days slow with basic drills to get their bodies ready for skiing. We should take a page out of their books.

These first few days are a chance to get your body feeling ready to take on the season and slowly increase the load on your body. After a long break, our body needs to readapt to the specific movements that skiing puts on our bodies as well as our muscles. An overexertion from the first day can be detrimental to the season and see your skiing take a step back in terms of quality.

Let's take a look at **five** ways that you can stop yourself from getting injured and also prepare your body for the best days of skiing that are yet to come.

### Stretch

No matter what you are doing in sports, no matter what level of sport, stretching is the most important thing that you can do both before and after participating in sports. It's not wonder that we instill it into our children that stretching is important even during periods when they are their most flexible. It doesn't matter what sport you are participating in, stretching has always been a large part of the warm-up for performance and safety.

Let's take a look at some stretches that are great for skiing...
