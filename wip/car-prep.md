Ski season is approaching and many ski enthusiasts are gearing up for the exciting trips they have planned to Japanese ski resorts. Putting in the time to make sure that gear has been fully checked out is important. But just as important as the gear on the hill is that which you leave at the base.

The snowy landscapes provide a beautiful landscape with breathtaking views but they also bring unique challenges to road travel. Winterizing your vehicle is a crucial step to make sure that your adventures on the mountains are a safe and enjoyable journey from start to finish. In this guide, we'll break down a preseason checklist to prepapre your vehicle for the Japanese winter.

### Winter Tires

**Why It's Important:** Tires are the main contact between you and the road. Even the best off-road car will be futile without a good tire to keep the vehicle in control. Winter tires are especially important to provide improved traction and control on icy or snow-covered surfaces.

**What You Can Do:** Ensure that your tires are equipped with winter tires designed for snowy and icy conditions. Within the four tires, make sure they their all have equal and ample tread for the snow to disperse. 

**All-season tires are not as safe as you would think.**

Let's look at some stopping data from the Ontario Ministry of Transporation. They took 3 types of vehicles and and tested in temperatures of -20Â°C with 3cm to 5cm of compacted ice and snow on asphalt. All vehicles were required to stop ina  straight line from a speed of 50km/h.

* All-Season (AS)
* Winter (W)
| Car Type | AS Tire Stopping Distance | W Tire Stopping Distance | % Improvement AS > W |
| :----: |  :----: |  :----: |  :----: | 
| Subcompact | 50.7m | 39.1m | ~25% |
| Minivans | 51.1m | 38.3 | ~28% |
| 4WD Vehicle | 42.8m | 38.3m | 11% |

All car types across the board received a significant improvement in stopping distance when using winter tires. The average improvement when changing to snow tires can be just over **20%**.

Would you risk your safety with those odds?

### Fluids and Battery

**Why It's Important:** Proper fluids like engine coolant, anti-freeze, windshield washer fluid, and engine oil can all help during the cold winters. Matching these with a strong battery will ensure that your car will start in the coldest of colds.
