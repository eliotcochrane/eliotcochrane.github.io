***

Tazawako Ski Resort often ranks on one of the top destinations within the Tohoku area. With a picturesque view overlooking Lake Tazawa, a great community of skiers, and an active host of events ranging from World Cups to the local snowboarders competition, Tazawako Ski Resort is a great place to go.

Packing really accessible terrain into a family friendly package that also entertains the powder-hounds is quite an achievement. Boasting some great powder days, terrain for almost every skier and boarder out there, and some small resort comfort, Tazawako Ski Resort is still a fan favorite among the local skiers and boarders.

### Getting There

Getting to Tazawako Ski Resort is a great drive on it's own. Coming from Morioka in Iwate Prefecture, driving along the ravines between mountains that were covered with fresh morning snow was beautiful. Each twist and turn with the morning snow shining like glitter going around each turn.

After following the ravine, we get a tiny glimpse of the lake before we head up the mountain. The mountain is littered with some summer events and some winter pensions to rent. Getting closer to the resort the fields begin to open up as we come across a cross-country ski course and then turn in to the parking lot for the Tazawako Ski Resort.

### Always Something

Every time that I have been to Tazawako, it seems there is always something going on. It just so happened that on the day I went, there were three different events that each took up a major course! 

The biggest was the National Snowboard Technical Championship. This is an event where it pits the top technical snowboarders against each other for who can perfect the best form. Some really great snowboarders descended and put all of their effort into the few tens of seconds that they are given.

The next biggest event was a snowboard time trial put on my the local snowboard shop. They tend to focus primarily on alpine carving snowboards but within the field, it was a mix of 50/50 between soft-boots and hard-boots. Although everyone was exclusively on carving boards.

The final event was part of the Akita SAJ instructor's test. Here the instructors have to perform the required exercises to a certain degree that an beginner would be able to watch and understand. In addition to the practical examination, there was also a paper test the day before.

Tazawako is always a place that is buzzing because in years past, they have also held Freestyle World Cups there too! 

### On The Hill

Tazawako Ski Resort starts off with three lifts right from the bottom. A lift to bring you to the start of the moguls that also brings you to the second lodge quickly, a slow double chair that is geared towards beginners, and a super quad to bring you mid-way up the mountain. Presenting you with the choices that you want right out of the gate is good.

From the mid-way of the mountain there is access to quite a bit of skiing already and some nice views overlooking Lake Tazawa. From there, one more lift going up and you reach the top of the ski area. Looking down on the national course that was used a few times for the national ski races, it overlooks the lake and also the surrounding mountains in a spectacular view.

From there, any sort of back-country skiers can go up further without restrictions. But for the majority of the skiers, the front side of the mountain is probably where most people will ski. And Tazawako brings quite a few different places to have fun.

At the top there is one slope winding around that is groomed but is pretty steep compared to the rest of the mountain. At the top there is also access to tree skiing and open ungroomed areas that turn into bumps later in the season.

Coming down to the mid mountain area it branches out into all sorts of trails but are relatively similar with a flat upper and lower which sandwiches a steeper portion in the middle. Oddly enough though, I found myself doing lap after lap on probably the most boring terrain.

All the way on the skiers right is a second super-quad that is great for mindless skiing because it's just the right slope for endless carving without over speeding. From that second super-quad is also a ski-cross course that is open to the public. It is great fun to take a few friends and hash it out to see who is the best.

### Lodge Feels

The lodge definitely feels a little bit strange compared to other places. Upon entering, you have to go up another staircase and exit a door there onto a plankway which leads to the ski racks. It feels just a little bit too cramped in the morning and skis are bumping the wall and people are going every which way. Not to mention, the rental area is right by the door so everybody renting is lined up in the same area.

Getting to the second floor you can buy your ticket there. If you know what ticket you want it's really quick and they still use a paper style ticket. From there it opens to the main room / dining hall. With the large windows it is certainly very bright and a great atmosphere. Many people will just leave their bags unattended on the side counters as there are no lockers that I could find.

Within the lodge, the types of food to choose from is pretty small. Outside of the regular ramen, udon, soba, and curry I couldn't find too much. For more appetizer type foods there was the "Fast Food Court" that had things like french fries and fried chicken.

### Access

Of course it is accessible by car. Coming from Morioka in the morning, it took me just over one hour to get there with stops on the way for breakfast and to go use the bathroom.

For those taking the train, take the JR lines to get to JR Tazawako Station. From there it is a 30 minute bus ride bound for Kogen (Plateau) Onsen/Nyuto Onsen. Be sure to get off at Tazawako Ski-jo Mae and you will be at the feet of the resort. This bus runs almost hourly.

**Choumin** is a series where Stray Lines will take a look into the smaller ski hills scattered around Japan. Choumin (町民) is roughly translates to citizen or local. With the idea of local people in mind, we hope to give you a little insight into the smaller places that often get overlooked as foreigners come to Japan to ski. While the bigger mountains do have their appeal, the local hills often have an atmosphere that is hard to replicate anywhere else. Come along as we explore these little nuggets of gold.
