## <center>Long And Skinny</center>
### <center>Why You Should Invest In A Pair Of GS Skis</center>

***

As the snow continues to fall, skiers of all levels eagerly prepare to slide their way down the hill on their planks of choice. Amidst the anticipation, skiers long for the days of endless powder and first tracks forever. While powder skiing is undoubtedly thrilling, dedicating time to work on the fundamentals can be a strategic investment in becoming a better and more proficient skier.

To work on these fundamentals, our first part will deal with long and straighter skis than usual. Here we will dive into three reasons why longer skis, with their focus on stability, speed and enhanced technique, can elevate your skills to make you a better skier to matter the conditions.

### Precision Carving
#### Technique With Stability

Giant slalom is an intricate dance between the skier and snow. This balance demands precise turns, balance, and control to optimize the skiers performance. Longer skis enable a stable platform that becomes a great opportunity to perfect your technique. The extended length creates a smoother rise, minimizing uneven terrain and allowing you to focus on perfecting your turns. Due to their length and sidecut, the longer skis also highlight flaws in your skiing that shorter skis may not reveal. Particularly, longer skis and a longer turn can reveal technique problems related to the symmetry and edging.

At the top of the turn, your skis transition from flat to on edge. If this edging can be done earlier, the better and smoother your turn will be. A longer ski will take longer to load the ski before the turn will initiate. Rather than jamming the ski on edge, a smoother transition by doing it earlier will save your legs over a full day!

Within the turn, the symmetry of your legs is important too. The symmetry is keeping your leg and movements parallel to each other during the turn. Putting an imaginary line through both of your lower legs, the similarity between these should be relatively close to each other. DOne correctly can allow for better balance, control, and higher edge angles.

### Speed and Rhythm
#### Fluid Transitions

The gracefulness needed for skiing requires a seamless transition between turns through maintaining adequate speed and the rhythm to bound from ski to ski. Longer skis, with their extended length, facilitate longer strides which enhances the ability to maintain speed and momentum down the hill. These longer strides can be through of maintaining a proper upright posture through the transition and not getting locked in a hunched position. Having a proper posture can allow the ski to propel forward without getting off-balance.

Picture yourself skiing with the everlasting long turns that a longer and straighter skis allows. Each turn a note contributing to the melody of your descent. 

 On the World Cup, many of these flowing turns have been replaced by a stivot turn to keep the speed and racing line in balance with each other. While many skiers look up to world cup skiers, not every turn is a beautiful arcing turn that follows the conventional skiing methods.
