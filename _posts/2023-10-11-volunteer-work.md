The leaves are changing color and the nights are getting colder. The covers are starting to come out as the AC's are no longer needed and the covers for the brushes around the house are brought out to be checked and mended before placed out for the season. It's fall and that means we are all getting ready for the winter season to begin.

Preparing a small ski area for the season in Japan is a labor of love that involves careful planning and attention to detail. Beyond the snowfall and picturesque landscapes, there are essential steps and considerations, including recruiting volunteers, inspecting lifts, and ensuring proper insurance coverage, that can often be overlooked. Let's look into the crucial aspects that allow you to ski every season.

### Trail Maintenance

A well-maintained trail is the lifeblood of a ski area. A well cut trail can be the difference between opening in mid-November or opening in early-December. As well as any skier can relate when a stray branch that didn't get cut suddenly finds the base of their ski to leave a friendly reminder of the dangers of skiing too early in the season.

Focused on removing obstacles, repairing permanent fixtures / fencing, and marking potential hazards, the work of done in the preseason gives large payoffs throughout the season. Japan's unique weather conditions like heavy snowfall, sea effect snow, snow monsters, and low temperatures lead to varied conditions skiers will encounter.

### Lift Inspection

Lift safety is a top priority for any ski area regardless of size. Meeting the standards and guidelines for safety by the manufacturer and also the governing bodies requires endless inspections for the safety of the skiers. Ski areas collaborate with certified technicians to conduct meticulous inspection on lifts, including cables, brakes, safety mechanisms, and structural integrity. 

Japan is well regarded for their safety in other industries and the skiing industry is no different. Skiing is a cherished pastime as maintaining safety on the hill is the best course of action to continue to grow the sport. Maintaining the highest safety standards is not just good practice, it builds trust and reputation to keep skiers coming back year after year.

### Volunteers

Like many small local skiing destinations all over the world, one of the unique aspects in Japan is the reliance on community spirit. Gathering year and year, teams of dedicated volunteers cut trails, clear trash, and maintain facilities. These dedicated members, often local enthusiasts, share a love for the sport and hope for people to enjoy the sport just a much as them.

Their efforts not only reduce operational costs but also create a strong bond within the community. Japanese culture is reliant on communities and the ski community is one of the most welcoming in Japan. No matter the level, no matter the intensity, if you love skiing you will always be welcome.

Preparing a ski area for opening in winter isn't an easy task. Many ski clubs are small but enthusiastic and prepare for the slope for everyone in the community to enjoy. Inspecting facilities, maintaining lifts, and cutting trails are done so visitors can enjoy the sport we all love. Hopefully these will leave a lasting impression for the next generation of skiers to take up the sport with as much passion.
