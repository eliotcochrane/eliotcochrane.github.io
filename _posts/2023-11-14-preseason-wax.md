## <center>Refresh Your Skis</center>
### <center>Guide And Tips To Get Your Old Skis Ready</center>

***

The ski season has already started in some areas of Europe and North America. It's time for us to get ready for when the white powder begins to drop on us! Today, we'll take a step into preparing skis for the new season. But instead of new skis, we'll be taking this from the angle that you have your favorite skis and will never let them leave your grip until they are dead and gone.

We'll be looking at storage wax removal, edge maintenance, base condition check, and then giving the skis the wax juice that will be so important once the slopes open. Come with us a little further as we start preparing our old skis for the season.

*This is a basic guide for those in need of a quick reminder of what to do without needing a race tune.*

**Remember to follow safety precautions and consider having a professional tune your skis if you're not confident in your own skills. Additionally, it's essential to regularly maintain your skis throughout the season to ensure they perform at their best.**

### Hot Waxing Techniques

Like most things in life, there are more ways to skin a cat than meets the eye (we don't condone skinning cats). Here are some great resources when it comes to tuning techniques. For the everyday skier, we'll look into basic ski waxing. Racers looking to improve their technique have some great resources.

### Storage Wax

Start by scraping the edges of any leftover wax that was put on to keep the edges rust-free and then move onto the base which was coated to prevent drying of the base. Imagine the base as a sponge. We want to keep as much wax in the base as possible. This wax had probably accumulated dirt and dust and protected the base over the summer season. Scrape the bases clean using a wax scraper and get the wax pores open with a good brass brush.

Don't be too concerned with getting the perfect finish. This step in the process is just clearing the way for what is to come. In this step, if there is any excessive dirt in the wax, maybe putting on another of the same wax and scraping while it is still warm is a good idea. This can remove the dirt before any other waxes are laid down.

### Base Condition

Before doing anything else, the next important thing to do is just give the ski a good inspection. Some of the things we'll be looking for are:

**Gauges / Deep Scratches** - These can impact the core if the damage is too deep. Keeping a good barrier and base depth is important to keeping the ski feeling as good as it does from the first day. Many deep gauges in the center of the ski may be repaired using p-tex and melting directly onto the ski, sometimes in small layers with many cooling phases in between. But if they are near the edge, enlisting a professional ski technician may be necessary to use metal grip which will adhere to both the base material and the edge.

**Flatness** - Using something like a flat bar or a 90° ruler to check for a flat base. If there are any large convex or concave shapes, have the ski stone ground by a professional technician.

**Edges** - Check for any burrs or nicks in the edge. A diamond stone can smooth out any rough spots found on the ski. In severe cases, using a file and guide may be the best route and smoothing it on over the length of the ski. Any major burrs and nicks not taken out before the waxing may damage the waxing iron.

### Wax Soak

Even with the summer wax providing protection against the elements and also against damage, the wax is impenetrable. Storage wax will not be enough to keep the skis from "drying out." Even at the World Cup level where keeping the conditions in tip-top shape is absolutely necessary, they are waxing the skis throughout the summer. But for the simple folk like us, it won't make a difference when we get on snow.

Apply a universal glide wax and let it cool for 3+ hours. Scrape and brush as though it were a regular wax session. Repeat 2 or 3 times to give the base the juice that it needs to glide.

### Priming The Base
#### (New Skis or Stone Ground Skis)

To really lock in that universal glide wax, we will use different variations of waxes to make the ski more versatile in all conditions. For the next step, we will be waxing the ski about 6 times with scraping. Brushing is optional.

* Warm-Temp
    1. Wax → Scrape
    2. Wax → Scrape
* Mid-Temp
    3. Wax → Scrape
    4. Wax → Scrape
* Cold-Temp
    5. Wax → Scrape
    6. Wax → Scrape

Starting from warm wax and progressing to cold wax, completely wax the ski about 6 times. The cold/hard wax used last will help to make a stronger barrier to keep the wax from drying out before the first snow.

### Edge Cleanup

Edges are just as important as the base. To keep you in control in varying conditions, a solid edge tune will be the difference between you traversing an ice ledge and you falling victim to it. If you choose to tune your edges and use a file guide, be sure to scrape and brush to expose the base for a better tune.

Using an edge guide and file, lightly run along the edge with the grip of a firm handshake. Let the tools do the work. If plastic is being taken off instead of edge material, cutting back the sidewall material may be necessary.

If you plan to remove only a small bit of material, a diamond stone may be more than enough for most. Using an edge file and guide is just about enough, maybe even less in powder. As a local go-to technician for many weekend warrior racers, I will prepare the edges at the beginning of the season. After each day of skiing, those skiers will just take a diamond stone or ceramic stone and lightly touch up the edges until they feel sharp again. This gives the skis a little bit more longevity because the edge material stays around much longer.

### Scrape To Go

For the last step, we probably left a few marks on our base after using the guide or any other tools to get the edge back in condition. For the last step, just take a mid-temperature range of wax and do a full wax and don't scrape. More than likely the first ski falls into temperatures that are from -4°C to -12°C. A mid-temp wax will surely fall into this category and leave you with just a scrape and a brushing before heading to the hill!

Get ready because the season will come sooner than you think!

## Newer Methods

As of late, there have been some innovative products and methods of wax application that **must** be mentioned. Let's take a look at some of them.

### Liquid Wax

Liquid wax is exactly as is sounds. The wax is already a liquidized and then applied in a rub-on form or in spray form. The wax applicator may already have a felt pad which absorbs and spreads the liquid on the base of the ski. Others may just be bottles that may be dripped on the ski and spread using folded wax paper or paper towels.

Once applied, these waxes require a drying time of approximately 15 to 30 minutes. Some waxes may leave a white haze when dried on the ski and others may not be visible when dry. Trust the system.

From here it is a light brushing and the ski is ready to go. Brushing too much or too aggressively will actually remove the wax that you just applied as the wax does not penetrate as deep into the base as a traditional hot wax.

**Positives**
- Beginner friendly
- Time efficient
- Hard to make mistakes
- Requires few tools

**Negatives**
- Becomes less effective quicker
- Still requires periodic hot waxes

**Overall**
This is a great waxing method during the ski season. It may not work for pre-season preparation but is a must-have for anyone that wants the best glide without spending hours during the season. It may still requires periodic hot waxes to keep the bases from drying out, but a periodic hot wax is much better than doing it every time and for every snow condition. Liquid wax is taking over much of the World Cup waxing scene for it's bullet-proof method of application and effectiveness when matched with a hot waxed base for the correct snow condition.
