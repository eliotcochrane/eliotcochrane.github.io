## <center>Snow Nihongo</center>
### <center>Simple Japanese For The Slopes</center>

***

A ski trip to Japan is on the bucket list for millions of skiers all over the world. The culture, atmosphere, food, and people make Japan a special place for people to visit. With a welcoming vibe and a culture that is like no other in the skiing world, Japan is the place to visit.

With Japanese resorts like Niseko, Hakuba, and Naeba taking the crown of "Most Recognized" ski resorts in Japan, these areas will likely have English-speaking staff. But interacting with the locals in their native language is a good way to make new friends!

**Don't be intimidated!**

Japan can be enjoyed just as much as anyone else even with limited English and gestures! But a little Japanese can go a long way. In this post, we will take a dip into the world of Japanese culture and the Japanese language on the ski hill. There are better guides for more travel-centric phrases, so we will focus on the on-mountain experience.

### Have Fun

When push comes to shove, the most important thing is to have fun. Not knowing Japanese is OK and you will have plenty of fun. Some things just have no borders.

But just like how the Japanese are friendly and kind, we should do the same for them. Saying 'please' (*onegai shimasu*) and 'thank you' (*arigatou gozaimasu*) go a long way for you and those to come in the future.

**<center>Get out there and have some fun!</center>**

### After Thoughts

As someone who has lived in Japan for 10 years now, I've seen a lot of people come and go. Even just staying for 1 year is enough for some and that's okay. But many of them leave for one reason: lack of friends.

This always hurts me because the Japanese people are so welcoming, but the times that you feel like a native will be nearly non-existent. You always get treated a little differently. Some days it's a real help, and other days it is a real struggle. But when it comes down to it, making friends is the best thing you can do for yourself mentally and physically too.

Making friends is what life is all about and not having perfect Japanese is not going to stop it. Get after it!
