### <center>Summer Skiing Far From Glaciers</center>

***

In the northern hemisphere, it's currently summer and year after year the temperature seems to somehow always get higher. While most of us in the northern hemisphere are in our off-season, those living in the southern hemisphere or with access to glaciers in Europe are able to ski.

What is someone supposed to do when they have their itch to get on skis?

Dry slopes.
