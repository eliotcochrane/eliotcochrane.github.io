Weaving holes throughout the red pine forest within Oshu City, Kurikoma Golf Club provides a great view of Mt. Komagatake as you make your way through the course. Designed with the idea of not modifying the natural contouring, the relatively flat course is complimented by the natural undulations throughout the course to give an elegant experience that leaves a taste to come back for more.

Originally built in 1978 with 18 holes, a further 9 hole expansion was built in 1990 due to the financial bubble. During the Japanese Bubble Economy from 1986 to 1991, access to expendable funds was more common and golf became a sport for the people. This rush for golf pushed Kurikoma Golf Club to invest in a further 9 holes to accommodate the appetite.

Claiming to be one of the top woodland courses, it attracts people from all levels of golf in the area. Of course, the members have priority when it comes to tee times and tee selection (back tee is reserved for members) but visitors are regularly in the mix and beginners are more often welcome than not. On top of that, Kurikoma Golf Club sponsors the prefectural player on the Japan Tour, Ren Yonezawa. Under new ownership, Kurikoma Golf Club is really looking to expand it's base of customers across the whole range within the sport of golf. That is certainly not the same to be said for some other courses.

### Club House

Driving to the club, like any other you get little peaks at the course. Arriving at Kurikoma Golf Club, you will drive alongside the first hole of on of the three routes. Pulling the car to the front, the clubhouse is quiet and doesn't stand out compared. At the club drop-off, you will be greeted by one or two staff members who will take your bag, put it in a cart which sings a lovely tune, and also take your golf bag and put it near the entrance for you.

After parking, you'll check in and head downstairs to the locker room and get changed. It's pretty standard from there. WHen you're ready, it's time to warmup.

### Pre-Round

#### Driving Range

Across the road from the clubhouse is a 250yd driving range. There are eight bays with soft mats with plenty of give to not hurt any muscles. A 100円 coin will give you 15 balls ranging from simple range balls to premium lost balls like Titleist ProV1's. The range is also open before and after the round so if you feel that something needs work after the round you are free to do so.

#### Putting Greens

Before stepping onto the course, a must do is warming up arguably the most important club in the bag, the putter. Here there are two greens with very little vertical change but they are different. One is relatively more flat for a general putting warm-up and the other is still relatively unchanging but sloped one way across the whole green to get a feel for how putts will break.

### The Course

*Course Statistics*
| Tee | Distance (yds) | Course Rating | | Par |
| Forward Tee | 5139 | Men: 64.6 / Women: 69.0 | 72 |
| Competition Tee | 6834 | Men: 72.6 / Women: 79.6 | 72 |

#### Tee Grounds

As this is a fairly flat course, the tees were mostly in a straight line towards the hole or dogleg on the appropriate holes. Only Hole 7 on the West routing was out of place for the forward tees. While Holy 7 on the West did have water in front of the tees for the regular and back, the front tees were on the other side of the water immediately looking up a steep slope. While the distance may be appropriate, the steep slope may prove troublesome. But on the following Hole 8 on the West routing, the front tees were the only one to clearly see the pin position on the left.

Above everything, the tee grounds were green and lush and the par threes that are usually littered with pitch marks were filled as as best they could. It's very clear that Kurikoma Golf Club puts time and car into their tee grounds. There were also no illusionary tricks by having the tee ground at a angle compared to the flow of the hole. All of the tee grounds were also flat with no slight undulations.

#### Fairways

During the year, the fairways will change from hard to soft and then to hard due to the rainy season (梅雨 *tsuyu*). Thankfully, during the time of play it was nice and firm so the rollout was pretty good. Kurikoma Golf Club touts a relatively flat course with undulations throughout. This is pretty fair. There were some awkward downslopes and upslopes but nothing that was extreme.

The fairway width also varied appropriately. A regular 250yd drive will give you plenty of options to look at the green but the further your ball goes, sometimes you may be too close to trees. But if your average yardage is between 270yds to 290yds, you will avoid all of the trouble if you can keep it on the same hole.

#### Rough

The rough was much thicker and heavier than typical courses around Japan. It's not uncommon at other courses for being in the rough but still have a good chance to make contact without grass between the face of the club and the ball. Not so at Kurikoma Golf Club. Sometimes your ball will settle right now into a little pocket of grass. This makes your club selection and mental endurance critical as sometimes your best option may be to not take the chance of a hybrid or fairway wood out of the rough and instead layup with an iron that can possibly give better contact and reduced stress from blowing up the hole.

If you have swing speed and power, it won't be a problem. But the club you choose will always make the difference.

#### Bunker

The bunkers at Kurikoma Golf Club are the typically sand that you would expect. At no time were any of the bunkers rock solid. Each of the bunkers had anywhere from 3cm to 6cm of soft sand with compacted sand underneath. All of the bunkers were soft and fluffy around the green making great recovery chances. Vice-versa, the bunkers were so soft it was hard to control out of the fairway bunkers. Making the fairway bunkers a real penalty!
