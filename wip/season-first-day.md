## <center>First Day Back</center>
### <center>Building A Foundation For The Season</center>

***

Ski areas across Japan are starting to open regardless of the El Ni√±o climate pattern projected for the season. With ski openings comes the annual first day back on the slopes. These first few days back on the slopes are the most dangerous for even the most seasoned skiers. It makes sense that even at the World Cup level, they too take their first days slow with basic drills to get their bodies ready for skiing. We should take a page out of their books.

These first few days are a chance to get your body feeling ready to take on the season and slowly increase the load on your body. After a long break, our body needs to readapt to the specific movements that skiing puts on our bodies as well as our muscles. An overexertion from the first day can be detrimental to the season and see your skiing take a step back in terms of quality.

Let's take a look at **five** ways that you can stop yourself from getting injured and also prepare your body for the best days of skiing that are yet to come.

### Stretch

No matter what you are doing in sports, no matter what level of sport, stretching is the most important thing that you can do both before and after participating in sports. It's not wonder that we instill it into our children that stretching is important even during periods when they are their most flexible. It doesn't matter what sport you are participating in, stretching has always been a large part of the warm-up for performance and safety.

Before stretching, be sure to get the blood flowing that way the stretches can be effective. After a light warm-up of jogging or walking, or even walking in your ski gear to the lift (which can feel like a workout by itself sometimes), feel free to begin stretching.

### Figure Eight Skating

Skating promotes a lot of fundamental skill through edging skills, balance, feeling of ski to ski, and just general fitness because skating can be tiring! Try using the figure eight skating drill to get your body warmed up, loose, and return some of the feelings before getting on the lift.

**Description**
On flt ground, the skier performs large figure eight design, on a variety of terrain, using skating and poling action of legs and arms. Skier should perform movements forward and balanced over the outside ski.

**Objectives**
* Promotes coordination
* Enhances edging skills
* Promotes lateral movement
* Enhances movement off of a working ski

**Variations**
* With horizontal pole
* Without poles
* Arms over head

**Notes**
Encourage skier to coordinate movement of the arms and the legs.

### Side Slip to Edge Set

Edge control through releasing and setting the edges is paramount to efficient skiing. Edge control is necessary for speed control as well as control over varied terrain and conditions.

**Description**
Skier steers both skis perpendicular to the fall line, with the upper body facing down the hill. Arms are held forward, crossing body to face down the hill also. Skier executes the task by releasing and setting the edges of the skis by rolling the ankles and knees into the hill (set) and down the hil (release). Edges are set with these smaller joints NOT the hips.

**Objectives**
* Promote edging skill
* Enhances balance and alignment
* Promotes upper / lower body separation
* Promotes lateral ankles/knee movement

**Variations**
* Diagonal side slip
* Without poles
* With pole plant (when edges are set)

**Notes**
Ensure that the skier is utilizing ankles and knees to set the edges, NOT hip!
Ensure skier keeps hands and arms balanced in front and down the hill.

### Norwegian Pole Plant

Pole planting is a great tool for timing and also resetting your weight in transition of the turn. Using this to help steer your skis and control your skis, the Norwegian pole plant is a great drill to also feel the pinch at the waist to get over the outside ski.

**Description**
In fall line turns, both poles are planted on the outside of turn, utilizing both arms, shoulders and hips facing down the fall line. Both poles should hit at the same time at a distance from the body that will help facilitate "pinch" over the outside ski.

**Objectives**
* Enhances timing/coordination
* Promotes upper/lower body separation
* Develops pole plants skills
* Enhances edging skills

**Variations**
* Add hop between turns

**Notes**
Ensure that the skier reaches with both arms to set the pole plant down the hill

### Outside Ski Only

Putting majority of the pressure on the outside ski is fundamental to powerful,coordinated, and controlled turns. It may feel counter-intuitive at first, the outside ski only mentality can bring your level of skiing to the next level with this simple drill.

**Description**
Skier performs task by lifting the inside ski of of the snow at the initiation of the turn throughout the completion of the turn; performing the entire turn balanced on the outside ski.

**Objectives**
* Develops edging skill
* Promotes lateral balance
* Enhances alignment
* Promotes coordination and timing skills

**Variations**
* Without ski poles
* With horizontal pole
* With Overhead pole
* Varied terrain and conditions

**Notes**
Ensure the skier keeps the inside ski completely of the snow throughout the entire turn
