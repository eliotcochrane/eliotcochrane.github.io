## <center>Preseason</center>

As the season draws closer, we'll look into the best things you can do to make your winter more enjoyable and safer too. These will range from things you can do for your fitness, mental preparation, and gear oriented changes that you can make before the season starts. Be sure to give each a good read and make a decision of what is best for you to make your winter in Japan fun and safe.

### <center>Guide And Tips To Get Your Old Skis Ready</center>

***

The ski season has already started in some areas of Europe and the North Americas. It's time for us to get ready for when the white powder begins to drop on us! Today, we'll take a step into preparing skis for the new season. But instead of new skis, we'll be taking this from the angle that you have your favorite skis and will never let them leave your grip until they are dead and gone. 

We'll be looking at storage wax removal, edge maintenance, base condition check, and then giving the skis the wax juice that will be so important once the slopes open. Come with us a little further as we start preparing our old skis for the season.

*This is a basic guide for those in need of a quick reminder of what to do without needing a race tune.*

**Remember to follow safety precautions and consider having a professional tune your skis if you're not confident in your own skills. Additionally, it's essential to regularly maintain your skis throughout the season to ensure they perform at their best.**

### Hot Waxing Techniques

Like most things in life, there are more ways to skin the cat than meets the eye (we don't condone skinning cats). Here are some great resources when it comes to tuning techniques. For the everyday skier, we'll look into the basic skis waxing. Racers looking to improve their technique have some great resources.

### Storage Wax

Start by scraping the edges of any leftover wax that was put on to keep the edges rust-free. This wax had probably accumulate dirt and dust and protected the base over the summer season. Scrape the bases clean using a wax scraper and get the wax pores open with a good brass brush.

### Base Condition

Before doing anything else, the next important thing to do is just give the ski a good inspection. Some of the things we'll be looking for are:

* Gauges / Deep Scratches - These can impact the core if the damage is too deep. Keeping a good barrier and base depth is important to keeping the ski feeling as good as it does from the first day. Many deep gauges in the center of the ski may be repaired using p-tex and melting directly onto the ski, sometimes in small layers with many cooling phases in between. But if they are near the edge, enlisting a professional ski technician may be necessary to use metal grip which will adhere to both the base material and the edge.

* Flatness - Using something like a flat bar or a 90° ruler to check for a flat base. If there are any large convex or concave shapes, have the ski stone ground by a professional technician.

* Edges - Check for any burrs or nicks in the edge. A diamond stone can smooth out any rough spots found on the ski. In severe cases, using an file and guide may be the best route and smoothing it on over the length of the ski. Any major burrs and nicks not taken out before the waxing may damage the waxing iron.

### Wax Soak

Even with the summer wax providing protection against the elements and also against damage, the wax is not fool proof. Storage wax will not be enough to keep the skis from "drying out". Apply a universal glide wax and and let it cool for 3+ hours. Scrape and brush as though it were a regular wax session. Repeat 2 or 3 times to give the base the juice that it needs to glide.

### Priming The Base

To really lock in that universal glide wax, we will use different variations of waxes to make the ski more versatile in all conditions. For the next step, we will be waxing the ski about 6 times with scraping. Brushing is optional. 

* Warm-Temp
    1. Wax → Scrape
    2. Wax → Scrape
* Mid-Temp
    3. Wax → Scrape
    4. Wax → Scrape
* Cold-Temp
    5. Wax → Scrape
    6. Wax → Scrape

Starting from warm wax and progressing to cold wax, completely wax the ski about 6 times. The hard wax used last will help to make a stronger barrier to keep the wax from drying out before the first snow.

### Edge Cleanup

Edges are just as important as the base. To keep you in control in varying conditions, a solid edge tune will be the different between you traversing an ice ledge and you falling victim to it.

Using an edge guide and file, lightly run along the edge with the grip of a firm handshake. Let the tools do the work. If plastic is being taken off instead of edge material, cutting back the sidewall material may be necessary.

If removing only a small bit of material, a diamond stone may be more than enough for most. Using an edge file and guide is just about enough, maybe even less in powder.

### Scrape To Go

For the last step, we probably left a few marks on our base after using the guide or any other tools to get the edge back in condition. For the last step, just take a mid-temperature range of wax and do a full wax and don't scrape. More than likely the first ski falls into temperatures that are from -4°C 〜 -12°C. A mid-temp wax will surely fall into this category and leave you with just a scrape and a brushing before heading to the hill!

Get ready because the season will come sooner than you think!
