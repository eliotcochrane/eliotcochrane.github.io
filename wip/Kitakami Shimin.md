### <center>True Golfing Spirit By Kitakami River</center>

***

Nestled alongside the Kitakami River in Kitakami City, Kitakami Shimin is regarded as one of the most popular golfing courses in Iwate. It may not have the crisp cut and manicure of Roseland Country Club or views like Appi Kogen Golf Club, but Kitakami Shimin is one of the go to places for those who truly love golf.

Relaxed staff who help you along the way and help introduce you to like minded people, the members and regulars alike make this a place to come back to again and again. Kitakami Shimin is a place for people who love golf to congregate and also to propagate a love for the game. It's a course that is cheap enough that the beginners who want to give it a try will do so, and the veterans love it for the great practice area that it is.

### Clubhouse

The clubhouse isn't the main attraction. It isn't a prefabricated building but it isn't much bigger than a few work sheds put together. There is just enough space for the front desk to check in and pay and also get some snacks and a coffee, next to that is the administrative area, and behind that is the kitchen and dining area. It's small but it has just the right amount of space to keep people flowing without much wait time throughout the day.

This is a no-nonsense clubhouse and a no-nonsense golf course. There are no locker rooms or showers. Once you check-in, you're free to prepare for your round in the chipping area and the putting green.

### Pre-Round

#### Putting Greens

There is one central putting green with a slight dome shape. From here many different areas can practice breaks as well as straight putting. More often than not, this is also a place where you will get someone to chat for a few minutes. Whether you are a foreigner or a new player, the members and regulars are friendly to new-comers at the course. The putting green serves as that friendly beginning.

Players ranging from juniors to seniors will spend their time before and after rounds putting. Even some of the locals who golf that may not be playing that day will take thirty minutes to practice. There is no fee for green practice besides the greeting to the staff. Many times the owner can be spotted checking the whether and making sure any events that are going on are held to a high standard.

### The Course

Kitakami Shimin is a 9 hole course. This means that you will play the same 9 holes twice but with different tee's each time.

#### Tee Grounds

The tee grounds of Kitakami Shimin are some of the best for their value. The tee grounds are all lush and green, the par threes have their divot holes but the tees are rotated around enough that it never feels like there is a dead zone. All of the par threes also have divot repair sand right next to the tees on any given day. For those that may not fill in divots, there are also people who fill in tons of divots during their wait.

The biggest drawback of the tee grounds are the forward tees. Sometimes they feel like an after thought and are almost literally part of the rough in front of other tees that have just had the grass cut short. Some we not leveled and were just cut down as is. There are also a few holes where the designers tried to avoid having a line of tees all the way to the green or fairway, so to do this they put some tee grounds on the sides of a given hole. But this also brings other hazards into the direct line that players from other tees don't have to worry about.

#### Fairways

Piping a ball down the fairway always feels good. While the strokes gained say that there isn't much of a stroke difference, there is one hell of a dopamine rush when you do! During the hot summer months, the fairways can get a little hard and drives roll a little bit farther than usual. That feels good. Not so good? Landing in someone's divot. Unfortunately, none of the cart riders bring divot repair sand to their ball. So if there are not many people walking the course with a bag in hand, it can get pretty spotty. Many of the regulars and members who walk the course make sure to fill their bag every hole and fill as many divots as they can but they can't get them all. This is not a problem just for Kitakami Shimin but many other places as well.

Divots aside though, the course is making a strong effort to improve the water run off to reduce any standing water or extremely damp and wet areas. Many holes in the past few years have had parts of the fairway or rough cleared for putting in piping and drainage underneath. Currently many of those areas have been filled in and are marked with blue stakes for a "Ground Under Repair" so any ball that lands in the area is a free drop.

That said, aside from the work they are doing to improve the fairways, what they have already is already in great condition. Mind you, this is also alongside a river so it can get fairly wet during the rainy season.

#### Rough

The rough is usually cut quite short and the grass blades are quite strong. More often than not, the ball sits up nice and high. This rough is obviously left to grow longer for the club championship, but nine times out of ten the grass will be a manageable length and easy to get out of. It may leave your ball high enough to cause a lot of fliers. Once you know the lie is likely going to produce a flier, it is easy to compensate but for the regular golfer it may be difficult.

The rough though is really manageable and approachable for new golfers and also maintains the pace of play. No searching for lost balls because most of the time you can see your ball land from where you were. And you don't feel heavily penalized by having to hack your ball out of the rough with a wedge just to get it out.

#### Bunker

The bunkers have improved over the years. Talking with the members and regulars, over the past ten or so years the amount of members and interest in the course has risen. This gave Kitakami Shimin a larger budget for sand and bunker maintenance. What used to have pebbles strewn about is now replaced with fairly fine sand. It may not the absolute highest grade, but it is consistent and easy to get the club through without getting a rock between the club face and the ball.

The largest problem facing the bunkers is standing water. Japan is a humid and subtropical climate so it's not uncommon for sudden rain showers that overwhelm the drainage that was put in at the time of construction. The bunkers that do build up water seem to be commonly known and limited to about five over the whole course.

#### Greens

This is one of the few courses that on their website actually lists the type of grass used on their greens... bentgrass. You know this course is serious about their greens when they specifically monoculture their green that matches their climate. The greenskeepers do a lot of work to keep the greens in good condition.

The greens themselves are not overly complicated but can be fooling to the eye depending on the condition. Also with bentgrass, if the greens are freshly cut there will be close to no grain. So you can focus on the slope and try to get a good measure on what the ball will do in the near future.

#### Marking

The marking at the course is easy to spot. Any of the colored markers are clear and visible without much dirt and grime. Any stakes marking out of bounds are mostly visible if not obscured by scrubs in front. And the tee markers are simple and clear. Alongside the holes are the distance markers, brown coloring with white bands. A single band meaning 100yds and then each additional band adding 50yds up to 200yds. THe max you will see is a distance marker with three bands.

As this is a course running side by side a river and a road, on all holes the left side of out of bounds. Yet on the inside of the course, there are yellow stakes to indicate a one-penalty drop. This is for normal play and to help keep the pace of people going. During the club championship, these yellow markers are changed to white markers signaling out of bounds.

### Lunch Break

Standard for the golfing model in Japan, taking a mandatory lunch is... mandatory. On Saturdays and Sundays this can sometimes be quite a long time to have lunch, do some putting on the practice greens, and also grab anything from your car that you might need for the next nine holes. Here, the staff will maintain the procession of the carts of the group during the lunch break.

Before entering be sure to clean the bottoms of shoes with the pressurized air gun, put your hat on the rack, an buy yourself a ticket. The menu isn't as expansive as other places and with good reason. There are only three people doing the whole lunch operation! From cooking to cleaning to serving, it's all done by three local ladies.

Unfortunately, the lunch service is only for the weekend. During the week, the dining area is open for use but you will have to bring your own lunch. If you do go for a weekday tee time be sure to bring a lunch or make a stop at a nearby convenience store.

### Post Round

Kitakami Shimin is as barebones as it gets. Once you're finished you return to the clubhouse where the staff will remove your bags and chat you up to how the day went. The staff will check the cart for any of your belongings and then take time to clean the cart if necessary. From there, the bags will be put to the side for the next cart to come along. 

There are two half-barrels filled with water for cleaning clubs and a grating to clean your golf shoes. Along the grating are multiple brushes to clean your shoes and clubs with. You may use the towels that you used on the course provided by Kitakami Shimin, or you may take a used towel out of the staff area to clean and dry your clubs and shoes.

There are no showers or locker rooms so once you have your belongings you are free to go! The staff will also give you a friendly farewell and thank you.

### Overall Experience

Kitakami Shimin gets at the heart of why golf is fun. Let's take a look at some of the things that makes Kitakami Shimin really shine compared to many fancier places.

**Positives**
- Low cost of entry
- Friendly and approachable staff

- Cart and walking options available
- Great course condition
- Early morning and afternoon starts
- Sociable members and regulars
- Great starter course

**Negatives**

It's hard to find where this club lacks other than the amenities of expensive clubs... which makes them expensive!

Clearly, Kitakami Shimin is the golf club for the average amateur, and that's not to say it hasn't produced talent.

It's clear that Kitakami Shimin is a place that is accessible for new comers and veterans alike to make a community that makes people want to love golf even more.
