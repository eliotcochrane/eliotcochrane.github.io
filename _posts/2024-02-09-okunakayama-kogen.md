***

Okunakayama is a modestly sized skiing area located in Ichinohe in the northern part of Iwate Prefecture. Almost one hour directly north of Morioka, this ski area can easily be accessed by car, lesser so by train and bus. But given it's proximity to much larger ski areas, it has been able to stay active and to keep slowly expanding every year.

Slowly but surely, Okunakayama continues to expand upon what is already available. Whether it be including tree runs, expanding them, purchasing new cross-country maintenance and race equipment, or creating more affordable options for local residents to keep them within the sport we all love.

### Borders

Okunakayama is quite northerly within Iwate Prefecture. While this limits customers from southern Iwate that may tend to ski at Geto Kogen Ski Resort, it does open the possibility for skiers and snowboarders from Aomori Prefecture to visit. The local skiers make up a majority of the population on the slopes but there are also lots of day passes and seasons passes sold to those outside the prefecture. It's not uncommon to see Aomori number plates speckled throughout the parking lot.

Many times, the passes sold to those outside the prefecture are often families from the military base that the United States of America operates in Misawa, Aomori Prefecture. They come to Okunakayama on the weekends as though it were just like home. English signage has increased within the ski area and the staff can also do their jobs in English. On top of that, there is also a military discount which acts as a great introduction for those looking to step their feet into snow sports for the first time. Tell the staff that you are affiliated with the military and they will ask for identification. Once confirmed you will get the discount.

### Upper and Lower

The mountain is clearly divided into two parts and very distinctly. The upper portion catering to the intermediate and advanced and the lower for the beginner. These two may not entirely mix and the lower only serves as an additional lift to get up the hill and a flat slope to return.

The upper is clearly defined by the forward facing slope. This is Hayabusa the first slope you will see of the mountain and it feels like two basketballs stacks on top of one another. With only half of the trail packed down, the rest is left up to the powder gods. It can feel extremely tight if you are a piste only skier, but the canvas really gets bigger with a step into powder. This also leads into the bowl section midway through with Tsubame which leads back down to the Fourth Lift.

On the other side, the Bunano no Ki leads into the top of the Sixth Lift which is the top of the race course, Konayuki. This is fairly intermediate with nice rollers and a few changes that are enough to get jumps with some speed. Bunano no Ki also leads to Yamabito which starts at the top of the Third Lift. It's a fairly narrow start but from the pitch change opens up a lot leading back to the lower section. Midway on the Yamabito section, there are also two separate slopes to choose from. The Yamabato trails is largely ungroomed but has great tree access under the Sixth Lift. The other side is the Shirakaba trail which is quite narrow but really fun to cut some short turns in front of the lifts as an audience.

Leading down to the lower part, we have the Beginner, Koguma, and Kamoshika. These are all essentially the same slope but divided by lines of trees. Also on the Koguma trail is the snow park. There are two to three kickers and then a small half pipe approaching the lift. The half pipe doesn't see much action but the jumps are always fun regardless of age!

### Beginner Tree Runs

Any look into the ski film industry that is in Japan and often times tree runs are at the forefront of the films. Some of them even being accessed just off the road! It's no wonder that even though the altitude might not be as high as some other countries, the back-country skiing scene keeps expanding every year as people experience tree runs and try to always get the first tracks. Many of them get their first taste of pow-pow at ski areas like Okunakayama.

Nearly five years ago, Okunakayama took the tree runs that they already had and cut many of the trees within the run and making it much easier to maneuver skis and also made introducing others to powder skiing a natural progression from the open slopes to slightly more narrow tree runs. Not only did they expand those runs, but they also made the mountain almost entirely tree run accessible with the exception of one spot leading to a river that doesn't have a proper exit. These spots are clearly marked with red tape. You may ski on the other side of the red tape but be aware you may have to hike. Anywhere you go, there will be tracks leading into the forest and exiting down below.

For many ski resorts, this would be unheard of because of the risks and insurance involved. But for Okunakayama this was one of the major selling points. Powder is not put behind a paywall at Okunakayama Kogen. If you can find it, you can ski it.

### Around The Mountain

Dotting around the mountains are some great spots to visit. Even day travelers come just for these places. On each lift ticket, there is also a discount for one of the two places listed below. Let's take a look around the mountain and the surrounding area and see what there is to do.

##### Okunakayama Kogen Onsen - 奥中山高原温泉

Right next to the ice cream place is a nice onsen. Like most onsens that have been around a while, it isn't the prettiest onsen but it has a great atmosphere. A popular spot that follows a day on the hill and also is a popular spot for locals with a view overlooking the part of the valley. The winter time is beautiful but summer and fall are just as beautiful.

Bring your ticket and show it to the staff when entering and get a 100円 discount!

##### Yuki Akari - 雪あかり

Directly below the lain lodge is a gelato shop that is regularly visited in summer because of the beautiful views and the locally sourced ingredients. It is a small place but customers are regularly going in and out. Of course, the standard flavors of vanilla and chocolate are great, but some of the rotating flavors are just as delicious if not more! My favorite is the sesame flavor (goma - ごま)!

Be sure to give them a look and get your 50円 discount!
