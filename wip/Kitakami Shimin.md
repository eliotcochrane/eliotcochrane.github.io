***

Nestled alongside the Kitakami River in Kitakami City, Kitakami Shimin is regarded as one of the most popular golfing courses in Iwate. It may not have the crisp cut and manicure of Roseland Country Club or views like Appi Kogen Golf Club, but Kitakami Shimin is one of the go to places for those who truly love golf.

Relaxed staff who help you along the way and help introduce you to like minded people, the members and regulars alike make this a place to come back to again and again. Kitakami Shimin is a place for people who love golf to congregate and also to propagate a love for the game. It's a course that is cheap enough that the beginners who want to give it a try will do so, and the veterans love it for the great practice area that it is.

### Clubhouse

The clubhouse isn't the main attraction. It isn't a prefabricated building but it isn't much bigger than a few work sheds put together. There is just enough space for the front desk to check in and pay and also get some snacks and a coffee, next to that is the administrative area, and behind that is the kitchen and dining area. It's small but it has just the right amount of space to keep people flowing without much wait time throughout the day.

This is a no-nonsense clubhouse and a no-nonsense golf course. There are no locker rooms or showers. Once you check-in, you're free to prepare for your round in the chipping area and the putting green.

### Pre-Round

#### Putting Greens

There is one central putting green with a slight dome shape. From here many different areas can practice breaks as well as straight putting. More often than not, this is also a place where you will get someone to chat for a few minutes. Whether you are a foreigner or a new player, the members and regulars are friendly to new-comers at the course. The putting green serves as that friendly beginning.

Players ranging from juniors to seniors will spend their time before and after rounds putting. Even some of the locals who golf that may not be playing that day will take thirty minutes to practice. There is no fee for green practice besides the greeting to the staff. Many times the owner can be spotted checking the whether and making sure any events that are going on are held to a high standard.

### The Course

Kitakami Shimin is a 9-hole course. This means that you will play the same 9 holes twice but with different tee's each time.
