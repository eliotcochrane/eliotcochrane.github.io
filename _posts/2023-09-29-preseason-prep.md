As winter approaches, every skier anxiously awaits the first dusting and hopes for the endless powder days. However, before you hit the slopes, it's crucial to prepare your body for the physical demands of skiing. Just like saving money, a little bit of targetted exercise each day can unlock better technique, enable you to chase the powder longer each day, reduce the risk of injuries, and keeping you healthier to continue skiing well into the future.

*Note: Exercises alone will not you a better skier. Better fitness will give you a higher potential.*

#### Technique Boost

**Strength and Stability:** Skiing demands a lot of power from the core, legs, and lower back muscles. Performing squats, lunges, planks, and leg raises can enhance stability, balance, and endurance. A full day on the slope requires all of these things.

**Flexibility:** Flexibility is important in any sport and skiing is no exception. Regular stretching before and after a workout are necessary. Even stretching routines based on yoga or other dynamic stretching can improve range of motion. These can lead to higher edge angles and more individual control over your body.

**Endurance:** All of the greatest flixibility and strength are nothing without endurance. Cardiovascular activities like jogging, running, and cycling are great. Even basic activities like walking are better than nothing. And combining the two with hiking can be satisfying as the season gets closer.

**Recovery:** While exercise is essential, so too is resting. Adequate sleep and post-exercise stretching can help to maintain energy levels. But more importantly, these can help your body be ready for more exercise and ready for more skiing adventures.

#### Stay Motivated

**Set Goals:** Define what you want to accomplish in your ski season. Whether it's technique based or a slope or mountain that you want to ski, setting a clear objective is a surefire way to keep you motivated.

**Variety:** Doing the same workouts on the same schedule can get boring. Varying up your exercise can not only be mentally stimulating, but also a good way to target various muscle groups. Cross training or playing a variety of sports is a great way to stay motivated and have fun.

**Visualize Success:** Spend a few minutes each day to envision your perfect ski day. Imagine the sensation of gliding down the slope or picture yourself conquering challenging terrain. Visualization can boost your confidence and motivation as the season gets closer.

Health benefits from exercising include a boost to your immune system, reduced risk to chronid diseases, and enhanced metnal clarity.

As you prepare for the ski season, remember that staying active year-round not only benefits your performance on the hill but also your quality of life.
