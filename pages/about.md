My name is **Eliot Cochrane**. I'm a life-long skier and a full-time tinkerer. Beginning to ski at the age of four, my passion for the sport has never diminished. I volunteer my time at the local ski hill to teach elementary aged children to ski and also coach the alpine ski racers at night on weekdays. Much of my time is now spent within the sport trying to give back and inspire the next generation to continue.

First coming to Japan, skiing was not even remotely on my radar. I was so excited to experience a new country that I had forgotten about skiing. Fate would have it, my very first night out on the town would be fated with the local ski club. With their broken English and my nearly non-existent Japanese, I was immediately invited to join. Like many ski clubs around the world, the average age of their members has been increasing every year. The age gap to the next youngest member was nearly double my age!

After getting a pair of women's SL skis from Ogasaka and having my old pair of Salomon boots shipped to Japan, I was ready to ski when the snow came. My first season was a loud wake-up call as I had been a relatively good skier in my hometown area in America. But little did I know that my little ski hill was a training hill for some of the regional athletes. With only one trail, a slow single pair lift, and blue and red ski gates lining the sides of the slope ready to be set, I made by first venture back into racing.

It was a blissful time as I progressed and could visibly see the times drop and my technique improving in pictures and video. Soon I was invited to the prefectural race tournament as support. Unfortunately I didn't have a national body membership so I couldn't race but I was able to support my new teammates. Still awe-struck with visiting a new Japanese ski resort, I schlepped bags full of outerwear and ski tuning boxes to the bottom. Snowplowing by each gate with their ever present gatekeepers doing double takes to see a foreigner on the race hill. In the following years, I have participated in every prefectural race.

From then on, I was back in the world of alpine skiing.

My childhood ski hills have really helped mold my preferences on where I like to ski. Preferring the locally owned hills, I always try to venture off the beaten path. It has lead me to meet incredible people, make connections throughout the Tohoku region of Japan, and continue a life-long love of learning.
