## DRIVER

#### SHAFT: Fire Express RR-B 6-TX

PRGR is not one of the major brands, but PRGR is always pushing the envelope for being such a minor company in the golf world. As a benefit from the Hole-In-One Insurance coverage by a friend, this driver was the first fully fitted club in my bag. More than anything, this club and shaft pairing drastically reduced severe hooks and slices. The miss is still two way but picking good targets now means that I can step up to the tee and not have doubt of where my ball is going to go.

The club is great in terms of speed and head weighting but it's main drawback is a lack of an interchangeable sleeve. Once the club is glued together, there is no going back on the setup. The sleeve does add a lot of functionality but can also hurt for weighting.

## FAIRWAY WOOD
###  HEAD: Titleist TS2 18°
#### SHAFT: Fire Express RR-B 7 TX

For no known reason, this club works so well for me. It was bought used with a Speeder shaft which was too whippy. Even then, it was still producing a lot of speed. Once I got a matching shaft with the Hole-In-One Insurance coverage, this turned into a deadly club off the tee and also a really good "Send it!" club on par fives. The interchangeable sleeve means that any sort of swing change over time (hopefully under the watchful eye of a coach) can mean that I can keep my clubs in the event that they do need to be changed slightly.

## HYBRID
### TaylorMade 2020 SIM Gloire U5 23°

Everyone that takes a look in my bag takes this club out with a chuckle. The Gloire series is the brand most commonly associated with lower swing speed golfers such as seniors and ladies. Although the Gloire brand takes many of the same technologies from the flagships series of TaylorMade, it is commonly overlooked when looking for deals. This particular club was a bargain special to compliment the longest iron I have. While my longest iron will have a lower height and longer run out, utility/hybrid will get a higher peak and steeper descent angle. Each club has their uses throughout the course.

## IRONS
### Honma TR20V (#5〜AW)

Another head turner when people peek into the bag are the TR20V irons. Honma is known for their Beres series which makes some extremely expensive irons using exotic materials. Honma also has some more earthly priced irons ranging from extremely chunky cavity backed irons to the sleek blades. These are right in the middle and provide enough support off the mishits while not being to big to get through the turf. 

Honma makes clubs but they also make great shafts too. During the fitting process, we started in the steel shafts but all of the steel shafts that Honma had on hand were not enough. Their regular customer is someone nearly double my age and struggling for speed. As a last ditch effort, they threw on a Honma produced Vizard 100 S shaft and it proved to be the shaft that best suited me within their available options.
