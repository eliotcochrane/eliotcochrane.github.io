PRGR is not one of the major brands, but PRGR is always pushing the envelope for being such a minor company in the golf world. As a benefit from the Hole-In-One Insurance coverage by a friend, this driver was the first fully fitted club in my bag. More than anything, this club and shaft pairing drastically reduced severe hooks and slices. The miss is still two way but picking good targets now means that I can step up to the tee and not have doubt of where my ball is going to go.

The club is great in terms of speed and head weighting but it's main drawback is a lack of an interchangeable sleeve. Once the club is glued together, there is no going back on the setup. The sleeve does add a lot of functionality but can also hurt for weighting.

## FAIRWAY WOOD

For no known reason, this club works so well for me. It was bought used with a Speeder shaft which was too whippy. Even then, it was still producing a lot of speed. Once I got a matching shaft with the Hole-In-One Insurance coverage, this turned into a deadly club off the tee and also a really good "Send it!" club on par fives. THe interchangeable sleeve means that any sort of swing change over time (hopefully under the watchful eye of a coach) can mean that I can keep my clubs in the event that they do need to be changed slightly.

## BOOTS

This boot changed my outlook on fit in a performance boot. After many years of custom fitting, this is the first where it all came together in one package. In 2022, the toe box had been expanded and during the 2021 season I was lucky to enough to test drive the boot a year early thanks to one of HEAD Japan's longest serving regional representative. Over three seasons, a few of the retention springs broke so some of the buckles are loose, the stretch on the power strap is too much and has been replaced with a Booster Strap, and the outer heel piece of the inner liner is falling apart. But no matter how many times I look at other boots, I always come back to it with joy. It's my comfortable cobbled mess.
